            "question": "How to diagnose Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "How is cryptogenic organizing pneumonia diagnosed? A diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms once other conditions that cause similar features have been excluded. This includes ruling out other known causes of organizing pneumonia. Additional testing such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or lung biopsy can confirm the diagnosis."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "How might cryptogenic organizing pneumonia be treated? The treatment of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) generally depends on the severity of the condition. For example, people who are mildly affected may simply be monitored as some cases can improve on their own. Unfortunately, the majority of people with COP have persistent and/or progressive symptoms that will require therapy. In these cases, oral or intravenous glucocorticoids can be given which often result in rapid improvement of symptoms."

It is characterized by a large number of small, brownish patches with a distinctive border, found most commonly on sun-exposed areas of the skin (particularly the arms and legs). DSAP usually starts during the third or fourth decade of life and rarely affects children. Lesions usually appear in summer and improve or disappear during winter. While it is usually benign (not cancerous), squamous cell carcinoma or Bowens disease may occasionally develop within patches. DSAP may be inherited in an autosomal dominant matter or may occur sporadically (in people with no family history of DSAP). Some cases are caused by a change (mutation) in the MVK or SART3 genes. Treatment is generally not effective long-term but may include sun protection, topical medications, cryotherapy, and/or photodynamic therapy."

Although the worms that cause schistosomiasis are not found in the United States, more than 200 million people are infected worldwide. Infection occurs through contact with contaminated water. The parasite in its infective stages is called a cercaria. It swims freely in open bodies of water. On contact with humans, the parasite burrows into the skin, matures into another stage (schistosomula), then migrates to the lungs and liver, where it matures into the adult form. The adult worm then migrates to its preferred body part (bladder, rectum, intestines, liver, portal venous system (the veins that carry blood from the intestines to liver, spleen, lungs), depending on its species.  Schistosomiasis is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. It can be treated safely and effectively with praziquantel."

            "answer": "How is schistosomiasis diagnosed? Examination of stool and/or urine for ova is the primary method of diagnosis for schistosomiasis. The choice of sample depends on the suspected species, which may be determined by careful review of travel and residence history. The sensitivity of this testing can be limited by the intensity of infection. For best results, three samples should be collected on different days.  A blood sample can also be tested for evidence of infection. Blood tests are indicated for travelers or immigrants from endemic areas who have not been treated (or not treated appropriately) in the past. The most common tests detect antibodies to the adult worm. For accurate results, the blood sample tested should be collected at least 6 to 8 weeks after likely infection. Blood testing may not be appropriate for patients who have been repeatedly infected and treated in the past because antibodies can persist despite cure. In these patients, blood testing cannot distinguish between a past or current infection. A specific blood test has been developed for this population (which can detect an active infection based on the presence of  schistosomal antigen), but this test is not commercially available in the United States and is currently being studied for its ability to detect mild infections."

            "answer": "Spondylocostal dysostosis is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of the bones in the spine and ribs. In the spine, the vertebrae are misshapen and fused. Many people with this condition have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The ribs may be fused together or missing. These bone malformations lead to short, rigid necks and short midsections. Infants with spondylocostal dysostosis have small, narrow chests that cannot fully expand. This can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Males with this condition are at an increased risk for inguinal hernia, where the diaphragm is pushed down, causing the abdomen to bulge out. There are several types of spondylocostal dysostosis. These types have similar features and are distinguished by their genetic cause and how they are inherited.  Spondylocostal dysostosis 2 is caused by mutations in the MESP2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include respiratory support and surgery to correct inguinal hernia and scoliosis."

The most common signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance are stuffy nose and skin flushing. Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body is unable to break down alcohol efficiently, usually found in Asians. These individuals accumulate acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, because of a genetic polymorphism of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) that metabolizes acetaldehyde to nontoxic acetate.[9184] The only way to prevent alcohol intolerance reactions is to avoid alcohol. Alcohol intolerance isn't an allergy. However, in some cases, what seems to be alcohol intolerance may be a reaction to something in an alcoholic beverage, such as chemicals, grains or preservatives. Combining alcohol with certain medications also can cause reactions. In rare instances, an unpleasant reaction to alcohol can be a sign of a serious underlying health problem that requires diagnosis and treatment."

            "answer": "Omenn syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by erythroderma (skin redness), desquamation (peeling skin), alopecia (hair loss), chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated serum IgE levels. Patients are highly susceptible to infection and develop fungal, bacterial, and viral infections typical of SCID. In this syndrome, the SCID is associated with low IgG, IgA, and IgM and the virtual absence of B cells. There is an elevated number of T cells, but their function is impaired. Omenn syndrome has been found to be caused by mutations in the RAG1 or RAG2 genes. Additional causative genes have been identified. Early recognition of this condition is important for genetic counseling and early treatment. If left untreated, Omenn syndrome is fatal. The prognosis may be improved  with early diagnosis and treatment with  compatible bone marrow or cord blood stem cell transplantation."

While most cases are attributed to mutations in the RAG genes (RAG-1 and RAG2 genes have been mapped to chromosome band 11p13), recent reports describe Omenn syndrome in the absence of RAG mutations. Omenn syndrome caused by mutations in ARTEMIS, ADA, ILRA2, ILRA7, CHD7, and DNA ligase 4 have been described in the medical literature.

As a result, glycogen accumulates in cells throughout the body. In GSD1B, specifically, glycogen and fats build up within the liver and kidneys which can cause these organs to be enlarged and not function properly. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop at age 3 to 4 months and may include hypoglycemia, seizures, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia (high levels of a waste product called uric acid in the body), and hyperlipidemia. Affected people may also have short stature; thin arms and legs; a protruding abdomen; neutropenia (which may lead to frequent infections); inflammatory bowel disease and oral health problems. GSD1B is caused by changes (mutations) in the SLC37A4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although there is currently no cure for the condition, symptoms can often be managed with a special diet in combination with certain medications."

            "answer": "Majeed syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the bones and skin. The two main features of this condition are chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA). CRMO causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling which can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures. CDA involves a shortage of red blood cells which can lead to fatigue (tiredness), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Most people with Majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as Sweet syndrome. Majeed syndrome results from mutations in the LPIN2 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Majeed syndrome? Majeed syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the bones and skin. There are two main features of Majeed syndrome: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), an inflammatory bone condition which causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling. These symptoms begin in infancy or early childhood and typically persist into adulthood, although there may be short periods of improvement. CRMO can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is a blood disorder which involve a shortage of red blood cells. Without enough of these cells, the blood cannot carry an adequate supply of oxygen to the body's tissues. The resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Complications of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia can range from mild to severe. Most people with Majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as Sweet syndrome. The symptoms of Sweet syndrome include fever and the development of painful bumps or blisters on the face, neck, back, and arms.

            "question": "What causes Majeed syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Majeed syndrome? Majeed syndrome is caused by mutations in the LPIN2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called lipin-2. Researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats. It may also be involved in controlling inflammation and play a role in cell division. Mutations in the LPIN2 gene alter the structure and function of lipin-2. It is unclear how these genetic changes lead to bone disease, anemia, and inflammation of the skin in people with Majeed syndrome."

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles and contractures. If CRMO does not respond to NSAIDs, corticosteroids can be used short term to control CRMO and skin manifestations. Resolution of bone inflammation has been reported in at least two children who were treated with an IL-1 inhibitor. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) may be treated with red blood cell transfusion."

            "answer": "Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is an inherited type of dystonia that typically begins during childhood but may begin in adolescence or adulthood. Depending on the specific type of DRD, specific symptoms can vary. Features can range from mild to severe. In most cases, dystonia begins in the lower limbs and spreads to the upper limbs over time. Symptoms may include unusual limb positioning; a lack of coordination when walking or running; sleep problems; and episodes of depression. Affected people also often develop a group of movement abnormalities called parkinsonism. Although movement difficulties usually worsen with age, they often stabilize around age 30. DRD may be caused by mutations in the GCH1, TH or SPR genes, or the cause may be unknown. Depending on the genetic cause, DRD may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (most commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. This form of dystonia is called 'dopa-responsive' dystonia because the symptoms typically improve during treatment with levodopa and carbidopa."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Dopa-responsive dystonia ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Dopa-responsive dystonia? The most common form of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is autosomal dominant DRD (caused by a mutation in the GCH1 gene). This form of DRD is usually characterized by childhood-onset dystonia that may be associated with parkinsonism at an older age. The average age of onset is 6 years, and females are 2-4 times more likely than males to be affected. Symptoms usually begin with lower limb dystonia, resulting in gait problems that can cause stumbling and falling. Symptoms are often worse later in the day, a phenomenon known as diurnal fluctuation. In rare cases, the first symptom may be arm dystonia, tremor of the hands, slowness of movements, or cervical dystonia. This form of DRD usually progresses to affect the whole body, and some people also develop parkinsonism. Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been reported in some people. Intellectual function is normal. Those with onset at older ages tend to be more mildly affected. Another form of DRD is due to a rare condition called sepiapterin reductase deficiency, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This form of DRD is also characterized by dystonia with diurnal fluctuations, but also affects motor and cognitive development. Onset usually occurs before the first year of life. Sleep disturbances and psychological symptoms (anxiety, irritability) are common later in childhood. A third form of DRD is autosomal recessive DRD, also called tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. This form is characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from those seen in the autosomal dominant form to progressive infantile encephalopathy. Onset is usually in infancy. Intellectual disability, developmental motor delay, and various other features may be present.

            "question": "Is Dopa-responsive dystonia inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is dopa-responsive dystonia inherited? Depending on the genetic cause of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), it may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. When DRD is caused by mutations in the GCH1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the gene is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent; other cases result from having a new (de novo) mutation in the gene. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Some people who inherit a mutated GCH1 gene never develop features of DRD; this phenomenon is known as reduced penetrance. When DRD is caused by mutations in the TH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have mutations in both of their copies of the gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms. When parents who are both carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. When DRD is caused by mutations in the SPR gene, it can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner."

            "question": "How to diagnose Dopa-responsive dystonia ?",
            "answer": "How is dopa-responsive dystonia diagnosed? Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms present, results of laboratory tests (sometimes including genetic testing), and response to therapy with levodopa. If DRD is suspected, a therapeutic trial with low doses of levodopa remains the most practical approach to the diagnosis. It is generally agreed that people with childhood-onset dystonia of unknown cause should be treated initially with levodopa. The characteristic symptoms and response to treatment are sufficient to establish the diagnosis for people with the most common form, autosomal dominant DRD. There is only one gene in which mutations are known to cause this form of DRD, but not all people with the disorder are found to have a mutation in the responsible gene. While finding a mutation may provide information about prognosis, it does not alter the treatment. Other types of laboratory tests, such as measuring specific substances or enzymes in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), may be useful to support the diagnosis. For tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, an autosomal recessive genetic cause of DRD, molecular genetic testing has confirmed the presence of mutations in all affected people to date. Specific laboratory tests performed on CSF help support the diagnosis but are not diagnostic on their own. For sepiapterin reductase deficiency, a very rare autosomal recessive form of DRD, there are distinctive findings in CSF and reduced or absent activity of sepiapterin reductase in fibroblasts. Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the responsible gene and confirm the diagnosis of this form of DRD. The major conditions that may have a similar presentation to DRD and are part of the differential diagnosis include early-onset parkinsonism, early-onset primary dystonia, and cerebral palsy or spastic paraplegia. People with specific questions about being evaluated for any form of dystonia should speak with a neurologist or other health care provider."

            "answer": "Glutaric acidemia type II (GA2) is a disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy. The severity of GA2 varies widely among affected individuals. Some have a very severe form which appears in the neonatal period and may be fatal; individuals with this form may be born with physical abnormalities including brain malformations, an enlarged liver, kidney malformations, unusual facial features, and genital abnormalities. They may also emit an odor resembling sweaty feet. Others have a less severe form which may appear in infancy, childhood, or even adulthood. Most often, GA2 first appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode of a metabolic crisis that can cause weakness, behavior changes (such as poor feeding and decreased activity) and vomiting. GA2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ETFA, ETFB, or ETFDH genes. Treatment varies depending on the severity and symptoms but often includes a low fat, low protein, and high carbohydrate diet."

Signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II (GA2) can vary widely depending on the age of onset and severity of the condition in each affected individual. In most cases, the condition appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode called a metabolic crisis which causes weakness; behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity; and vomiting. These crises can be life-threatening and may be triggered by common childhood illnesses or other stresses on the body. The most severe cases may appear in the neonatal period (within the first 4 weeks of life) and may also be characterized by the presence of physical abnormalities at birth. These abnormalities may include brain malformations; an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly); a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy); fluid-filled cysts and other malformations of the kidneys; unusual facial features; and genital abnormalities. Some affected individuals have a characteristic odor resembling sweaty feet. Other cases are less severe and may appear later in childhood, in adolescence, or in adulthood.

However, children who have repeated metabolic crises may develop life-long learning problems. Individuals with glutaric acidemia type II should consult with a metabolic doctor and a dietician who can help to develop an appropriate dietary plan. Some treatments may be recommended for some children but not for others. When necessary, treatment should be continued throughout the lifetime. The following treatments are often recommended:     -Avoidance of fasting. Infants and young children with glutaric acidemia type II should eat frequent meals in order to prevent hypoglycemia and metabolic crises.     -A low-fat, low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may be advised.     -Riboflavin, L-carnitine and glycine supplements may be needed.

Treatment is determined by the size and location of each particular cancer and the extent to which cancer cells may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or tissues.  Surgery is often the first step and aims to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Both a traditional surgical technique, known as wide local excision, and the newer Mohs micrographic surgery have been used to remove hidradenocarcinomas.  Radiation therapy, performed by a doctor known as radiation oncologist, has been used after surgery in patients with hidradenocarcinoma to destroy any cancer cells that may remain at the original location of the tumor or in the lymph nodes.  Chemotherapy, performed by a doctor known as a medical oncologist, has not yet been proven as effective treatment for hidradenocarcinomas."

            "answer": "What causes familial or genetic hypolipoproteinemia? Cholesterol levels in general are thought to be influenced by genetic factors. Very low levels of lipids (hypolipoproteinemia) is known to be caused by certain genetic conditions, including hypobetalipoproteinemia, abetalipoproteinemia, and chylomicron retention disease.  Hypobetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Autosomal dominant inheritance is when one mutated copy of the gene that causes a disorder in each cell is needed for a person to be affected. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. Autosomal dominant disorders tend to occur in every generation of an affected family. When a person with an autosomal dominant disorder has a child, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit the condition.  In some families the condition is due to mutations in a gene called APOB, in other families the underlying mutation has not been identified. People with this condition usually do not experience symptoms. People who inherit two hypobetalipoproteinemia gene mutations may have extremely low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Some of these individuals have no symptoms while others  have developed fatty liver, intestinal fat malabsorption, and neurological problems. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. It is passed through families in an autosomal recessive pattern. Click here to learn more about autosomal recessive inheritance. The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia may include failure to thrive, diarrhea, abnormal star-shaped red blood cells, and fatty, foul-smelling stools in infants, nervous system impairment in children, retinitis pigmentosa and difficulty with balance and walking in childhood or adulthood. Chylomicron retention disease is a rare condition with approximately 40 cases described worldwide and is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The signs and symptoms appear in the first few months of life and may include failure to thrive, diarrhea, fatty, foul-smelling stools, and later nervous system impairment.

Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces insulin but does not use it properly. This causes the pancreas to produce more insulin. High levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to make too much androgen, leading too excessive  hair growth, acne, and irregular periods. Insulin resistance can also lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and excessive growth and darkening of the skin (aconthosis nigricans). Women with HAIR-AN may be born with insulin resistance or acquire it over time."

            "question": "What is (are) Tetra-amelia syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Tetra-amelia syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs. This syndrome can also cause severe malformations of other parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia. The lungs are underdeveloped in many cases, which makes breathing difficult or impossible. Because children with tetra-amelia syndrome have such serious medical problems, most are stillborn or die shortly after birth. The condition has been associated with a mutation in the WNT3 gene in one family, and it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

            "answer": "Anencephaly is a type of neural tube defect characterized by abnormal development of the brain and the bones of the skull. The neural tube is a narrow channel that normally folds and closes between the 3rd and 4th weeks of pregnancy, forming the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Anencephaly occurs when the 'cephalic' or head end of the neural tube fails to close, causing the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without a forebrain (the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed (not covered by bone or skin). Affected babies are usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth, although some may survive a few hours or a few days after birth. Anencephaly is likely caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown."

            "question": "What causes Anencephaly ?",
            "answer": "What causes anencephaly? The underlying cause of anencephaly is not fully understood. Like other forms of neural tube defects (NTDs), anencephaly is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown. Variations in many genes may influence the risk of developing anencephaly. The best-studied gene thus far is the MTHFR gene, which gives the body instructions to make a protein used to process the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). A deficiency of folate is a known risk factor for NTDs. Other genes involved in folate processing, and the development of the neural tube, may also affect the risk. Researchers have also looked at environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. Folate appears to play a significant role, and studies have shown that taking folic acid (a form of folate), before getting pregnant and very early in pregnancy, significantly reduces the risk to have a baby with a NTD. Other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus; obesity; exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy; and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy."

            "question": "Is Anencephaly inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is anencephaly inherited? Most cases of anencephaly are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no family history of anencephaly or other neural tube defects (NTDs). In some cases, it may be associated with a chromosome abnormality, a severe malformation syndrome, or disruption of the amniotic membrane. A small portion of cases have appeared to be familial, but it often does not have a clear inheritance pattern. In isolated populations, anencephaly has been suspected to be due to a single gene. In Iranian Jews, who have high rates of consanguinity (mating with family members), it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Parents who have had a child with anencephaly are at an increased risk to have another affected child (compared with the risk in the general population). Because most cases are believed to be multifactorial (due to interaction of genetic and environmental factors), the recurrence risk is estimated to be between 2% and 5% after a single case. If anencephaly is known to be associated with an underlying disorder, the recurrence risk may depend on that of the underlying disorder. For women who have previously had a fetus or infant with anencephaly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends increasing the intake of folic acid to 4mg per day beginning at least one month prior to conception. People who have had a pregnancy or child with anencephaly or another NTD, and have questions about future risk, are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional."

            "answer": "Isolated ectopia lentis (IEL) is a genetic disorder that affects the positioning of the lens in the eyes. In individuals with IEL, the lens in one or both of the eyes is off-center. Symptoms of IOL usually present in childhood and may include vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision (astigmatism), clouding of the lenses (cataracts), and increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma). In some individuals, IEL can progress to retinal detachment (tearing of the back lining of the eye). IEL is caused by mutations in either the FBN1 or ADAMTSL4 gene. When caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene, IEL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. When caused by a mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene, IEL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The primary goal of treatment is preventing amblyopia (lazy eye) through early correction of astigmatism. Surgical intervention including lensectomy (removal of the lens) may be considered in cases where vision is significantly affected."

            "answer": "Valinemia is a very rare metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine. Infants with valinemia reportedly experience lack of appetite, vomiting, and failure to thrive. In some cases, the condition may be life-threatening. Low muscle tone (hypotonia), excessive drowsiness, hyperactivity, and developmental delay have also been reported. Valinemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme valine transaminase, which is needed for the breakdown (metabolism) of valine in the body. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although the gene responsible for the condition is not yet known. Treatment includes a diet low in valine (introduced during early infancy) which usually improves symptoms and brings valine levels to normal."

            "answer": "Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) in men may be considered as the condition of priapism and unwanted ejaculatory fluids being released without any sexual interest. In women there is still no consensus about a formal definition, but some of the experts propose that in women it should be defined as a rare, unwanted, and intrusive sexual dysfunction associated with excessive and unremitting genital arousal and engorgement in the absence of sexual interest. The persistent genital arousal usually does not resolve with orgasm and causes personal distress. Features include excessive excitement or excessive genital (lubrication, swelling, and engorgement) or other somatic responses. Causes may be neurological (central or peripheral involving the pudendal nerve), related to medication, vascular, hormonal, psychological or others.  Diagnosis of the cause is essential for an adequate patient management. The treatment may include avoiding offending medications, using medications that stabilize nerve transmission and/or effect mood, local topical anesthetic agents, ice and hormonal replacement. More recently PGAD has being described as one component of a broader Restless Genital Syndrome if the PGAD was also associated with urinary frequency/urgency and restless leg syndrome."

Affected individuals usually become symptomatic between the ages of 5 and 25, though onset can range from infancy to after the third decade of life. The most common first symptom is weakness of the feet and ankles, followed by slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of distal muscles in the feet and/or hands. Individuals often have decreased tendon reflexes and mild or no sensory loss. Adults with CMT2 often have bilateral foot drop, symmetric atrophy of muscles below the knee (stork leg appearance) and absent tendon reflexes in the legs. Mild sensory deficits of position, vibration, pain or temperature may occur in the feet, or sensation may be intact. Pain (especially in the feet) is reported by about 20%-40% of affected individuals. Other features that may be associated with CMT2 in a few individuals include hearing impairment; vocal cord or phrenic nerve involvement (which may result in difficulty with speech or breathing); restless legs; and sleep apnea. CMT2 is progressive over many years, but affected individuals often experience long periods without obvious progression. In some individuals, the condition may be so mild that it goes unrecognized.

            "answer": "What causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F? Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) is caused by mutations in the HSPB1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (heat shock protein beta-1) which helps protect cells under adverse conditions. Heat shock proteins appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement, stabilizing the cell's framework, folding and stabilizing new proteins, repairing damaged proteins, and muscle contraction. Heat shock protein beta-1 is particularly abundant in nerve and muscle cells. In nerve cells, it helps to organize a network of threads that maintain the diameter of axons (neurofilaments), which are needed to transmit nerve impulses efficiently. It is unclear exactly how HSPB1 mutations lead to the axon abnormalities characteristic of CMT2F. Researchers suggest that mutations lead to an altered protein which clusters together and interferes with nerve cell function. Another possibility is that the altered protein disrupts the assembly of neurofilaments, which in turn may impair the transmission of nerve impulses."

Individuals with MEN 2A are at high risk of developing medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. About 50% will develop pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands which may increase blood pressure. Individuals with MEN 2A are also at increased risk for parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia (overgrowth of the parathyroid gland). Occasionally an itchy skin condition called cutaneous lichen amyloidosis also occurs in people with type 2A disease. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

It may involve one bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic). Fibrous dysplasia can affect any bone in the body. The most common sites are the bones in the skull and face, the long bones in the arms and legs, the pelvis, and the ribs. Though many individuals with this condition do not have any symptoms, others may have bone pain, abnormally shaped bones, or an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). This condition can occur alone or as part of a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome. While there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia, the symptoms can be treated. Medications known as bisphosphonates can reduce pain and surgery may be indicated for fractures or to correct misshapen bones."

The most common symptoms are bone pain, bone deformities, fractures, and skin pigmentation differences (light brown spots on the skin). The problems that a person experiences depend on the specific bone(s) affected. For example, if the legs are of different lengths, they might limp when they walk; if the bones in the sinuses are affected, chronic sinus congestion may be a present. In rare cases, fibrous dysplasia is associated with abnormalities in the hormone-producing glands of the endocrine system. This may lead to precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism (excess thyroid hormone production), excess growth hormone (gigantism or acromegaly), and/or excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome). If the face or skull bones are affected, hearing or vision loss may occur."

            "question": "What causes Fibrous dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "What causes fibrous dysplasia? The cause of fibrous dysplasia has been linked to a gene mutation that occurs after conception, in the early stages of fetal development. The mutation involves a gene that affects the cells that produce bone. People with fibrous dysplasia carry this mutation in some, but not all cells of their body. It is not well understood why the mutation occurs, but it is not inherited from a parent, nor can it be passed on to future offspring."

Fractures often require surgery, but can sometimes be treated with casting or splints.] Surgery is most appropriate in cases where fractures are likely to occur, or where bones have become misshapen. Surgery may also be used to relieve pain. Medications known as bisphosphonates are also used to relieve bone pain. Other healthy strategies such as physical activity and adequate intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are also encouraged.[  Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with fibrous dysplasia because it is associated with an increased risk of cancerous transformation. Careful, long-term follow-up to monitor fibrous dysplasia is advised."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Lafora disease? The signs and symptoms of Lafora disease generally appear during late childhood or adolescence. Prior to the onset of symptoms, affected children appear to have normal development although some may have isolated febrile or nonfebrile convulsions in infancy or early childhood. The most common feature of Lafora disease is recurrent seizures. Several different types of seizures have been reported including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, occipital seizures (which can cause temporary blindness and visual hallucinations) and myoclonic seizures. These seizures are considered \"progressive\" because they generally become worse and more difficult to treat over time. With the onset of seizures, people with Lafora disease often begin showing signs of cognitive decline. This may include behavioral changes, depression, confusion, ataxia (difficulty controlling muscles), dysarthria, and eventually, dementia.

These genes encode proteins that play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Although the proteins are thought to have many functions in the body, one important role is to help regulate the production of a complex sugar called glycogen (an important source of stored energy in the body). Mutations in the EPM2A gene or the NHLRC1 gene interfere with the production of functional proteins, leading to the formation of Lafora bodies (clumps of abnormal glycogen that cannot be broken down and used for fuel) within cells. A build up of Lafora bodies appears to be especially toxic to the cells of the nervous system and leads to the signs and symptoms of Lafora disease."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A? CMT1 is generally slowly progressive over many years. However, affected individuals often experience long periods without any obvious deterioration or progression. Occasionally, individuals show accelerated deterioration of function over a few years. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) tend to slow progressively over the first two to six years of life, but they appear to remain relatively stable throughout adulthood. Worsening of signs and symptoms tends to be slow in the second to fourth decades of life. It remains to be confirmed whether, and to what extent, there is clinical and electrophysiological disease progression in affected adults; two studies of adult with CMT1A have shown conflicting results. Authors of one study reported disease progression over time (23 years on average), while authors of another study found that both patients and controls (individuals without the condition) had a similar decline of strength and of electrophysiological findings. The findings in the latter study suggested that the decline in adulthood in affected individuals may reflect a process of normal aging rather than on-going active disease. Any major changes in the pace of progression may warrant consideration of additional acquired, or possibly independently inherited forms, of neuromuscular diseases. The severity of signs and symptoms of CMT1A can vary greatly among affected individuals. Individuals who have questions about their own specific signs and symptoms and how they may relate to progression of CMT should speak with their health care provider. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Areflexia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cold-induced muscle cramps - Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - Decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Foot dorsiflexor weakness - Hammertoe - Hearing impairment - Heterogeneous - Hypertrophic nerve changes - Hyporeflexia - Insidious onset - Juvenile onset - Kyphoscoliosis - Myelin outfoldings - Onion bulb formation - Pes cavus - Segmental peripheral demyelination/remyelination - Slow progression - Steppage gait - Ulnar claw - Variable expressivity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What is (are) Neurofibromatosis ?",
            "answer": "Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic condition that causes tumors to develop in the nervous system. There are three types of neurofibromatosis that are each associated with unique signs and symptoms: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes (cafe-au-lait spots, freckling in armpit and groin area); bone abnormalities; optic gliomas; and tumors on the nerve tissue or under the skin. Signs and symptoms are usually present at birth. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) causes acoustic neuromas; hearing loss; ringing in the ears; poor balance; brain and/or spinal tumors; and cataracts at a young age. It often starts in the teen years. Schwannomatosis causes schwannomas, pain, numbness, and weakness. It is the rarest type. All three types of NF are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There is no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and may include surgery to remove tumors, radiation therapy and/or medicines."

            "answer": "Is neurofibromatosis inherited? Neurofibromatosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with neurofibromatosis has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "question": "What is (are) Cold agglutinin disease ?",
            "answer": "Cold agglutinin disease is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32 to 50 F), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms. Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause."

            "answer": "How is cold agglutinin disease diagnosed? A diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease may be made after several types of tests are performed by a health care provider. In some cases, the diagnosis is first suspected by chance if a routine complete blood count (CBC) detects abnormal clumping (agglutination) of the red blood cells. In most cases, the diagnosis is based on evidence of hemolytic anemia (from symptoms and/or blood tests). A person may also be physically examined for spleen or liver enlargement. An antiglobulin test (called the Coombs test) may be performed to determine the presence of a specific type of antibody. In people with cold agglutinin disease, the Coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM).

            "answer": "How might cold agglutinin disease be treated? The treatment of cold agglutinin disease depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause. For example, in those affected by secondary cold agglutinin disease, it is important to diagnose and treat the underlying condition which may include certain types of cancer; bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; and/or other autoimmune disease. People with few symptoms and/or mild anemia may not require any specific treatment. These cases are often managed by simply avoiding exposure to the cold. In severe cases, medical interventions may be necessary. Rituximab (an antibody that selectively reduces specific types of immune cells) may be recommended either alone or in combination with other medications for people with severe hemolysis. Plasmapheresis, which involves filtering blood to remove antibodies, and/or blood transfusions may be an option for temporary relief of severe symptoms. Other therapies exist; however, they have been used with variable success. Medscape Reference's Web site offers more specific information about these alternative treatments.

It occurs in the abdomen near the adrenal glands, but it can also occur in other parts of the body.  It is considered an aggressive tumor because it often spreads to other parts of the body (metastasizes).  The symptoms of a neuroblastoma may include a lump in the abdomen, pain, diarrhea, or generally feeling unwell.  It affects one out of 100,000 children.  The exact cause of this tumor is not yet known.  Neuroblastoma may be diagnosed by physical examination; specific blood tests; imaging tests such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scans; and a biopsy.  Treatment depends on the size and location of the tumor within the body, as well as the childs age.

            "answer": "What causes EEC syndrome? Approximately 90% of individuals with EEC syndrome have a causative mutation identified in the TP63 gene. The TP63 gene codes for the p63 protein, which plays a critical role in early development of the ectoderm-the layers of tissue that develop into the skin, hair, teeth, and nails. The p63 protein is additionally thought to play a role in the development of the limbs, facial features, urinary system, and other organs. Individuals that have EEC syndrome due to a mutation in the TP63 gene are classified as having EEC syndrome type 3 (EEC3). In approximately 10% of individuals, EEC syndrome is caused by a mutation on a region of the q (long) arm of chromosome 7. Individuals that have EEC syndrome due to a mutation on the q arm of chromosome 7 are classified as having EEC syndrome type 1 (EEC1). Rarely, EEC syndrome can be found in individuals that do not have mutations in either the TP63 gene or the q arm of chromosome 7."

            "question": "Is EEC syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is EEC syndrome inherited? EEC syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a de novo mutation. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. EEC can appear to be caused by a de novo mutation in some instances when an unaffected parent of an affected child has germline mosaicism. Germline mosaicism affects the genetic make-up of the egg and sperm cell only. It is estimated that unaffected parents of a child with EEC syndrome have a 4% risk of having another affected child. EEC syndrome additionally shows reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Reduced penetrance means that not all individuals with a mutation in the disease-causing gene will have signs and symptoms of the condition; however, in this condition, it has been reported that up to 93-98% of individuals with a mutation will have the condition. Variable expressivity means that there is a range of signs and symptoms that can occur in different people with the condition (i.e. the expression of the condition varies)."

            "question": "What is (are) Sprengel deformity ?",
            "answer": "Sprengel deformity is a congenital condition characterized by abnormal development and elevation of the shoulder blade (scapula). Severity can range considerably from being almost invisible when covered with clothes, to the shoulder being elevated over 5 centimeters, with neck webbing. Signs and symptoms may include a lump in the back of the base of the neck and limited movement in the shoulder or arm. The condition may also be associated with other skeletal (bone or cartilage) or muscular abnormalities. Sprengel deformity typically occurs sporadically for no apparent reason but autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported. It is caused by an interruption of normal development and movement of the scapula during early fetal growth (probably between the 9th and 12th weeks of gestation). Treatment often includes physical therapy, but severe cases may require surgery to improve cosmetic appearance and scapular function."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Sprengel deformity ?",

Signs and symptoms of Sprengel deformity can vary depending on the severity and whether additional skeletal or muscular abnormalities are present. Some people may not have noticeable signs or symptoms. It more commonly occurs on the left side, but can occur on both sides (bilaterally). In addition to shoulder asymmetry, the elevated shoulder blade may cause a lump in the back of the base of the neck; underdeveloped or incomplete muscles in the surrounding area; and limited movement of the shoulder and arm on the affected side. Some people have bone, cartilage or fiber- like tissue between the shoulder blade and the spinal bones (vertebrae) next to it. Other features that have been found in association with Sprengel deformity include: scoliosis Klippel Feil syndrome limb length discrepancy an underdeveloped backbone (hemivertebrae) missing, fused, or extra ribs (cervical ribs) abnormalities of the collarbone abnormalities of the chest organs of the body displaced on the opposite side (ex: liver on the left and heart on the right) spina bifida occulta cleft palate The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Sprengel deformity.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Sprengel deformity ?",
            "answer": "How might Sprengel deformity be treated? Treatment of Sprengel deformity depends on the degree of functional impairment and/or cosmetic disfigurement. Many people with Sprengel deformity do not need surgery and may have physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strengthen weak muscles. For those who do require surgery, the goals are to release the binding of the scapula and relocate the scapula. Surgery can improve the cosmetic appearance and contour of the neck, and improve the scapular function when it is severely impaired. However, the ability to increase shoulder abduction is limited. For surgical indication, many experts refer to the Cavendish classification - one method used for grading the severity of Sprengel deformity. This method classifies the condition into grades I through IV, with grade I being the most mild (almost invisible when covered with clothes) and grade IV being the most severe (with over 5 centimeters of elevation of the shoulder, and neck webbing). Although no improvement or worsening has been reported in untreated grade I and II cases, surgery is recommended in grade III and IV deformities. However, the Cavendish classification may be subjective and inaccurate since it is based on the structure of the deformity (rather than function) and aesthetic criteria. The optimal age for surgery is controversial, but most experts recommend that it be done before age 8 to obtain the best surgical result. There are several surgical options that may be considered depending on each person's situation. Many of the surgical procedures for Sprengel deformity leave unsightly scars, so the cosmetic improvement must be carefully considered."

Many people with Buerger disease will show hypersensitivities to injection of tobacco extracts into their skin. There may be a genetic component to susceptibility to Buerger disease as well. It is possible that these genetic influences account for the higher prevalence of Buerger disease in people of Israeli, Indian subcontinent, and Japanese descent.

Non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH) is diagnosed by taking a biopsy of the skin mark and examining the tissue under a microscope.  NICH looks different under the microscope than most infantile hemangiomas because the blood vessels are arranged more irregularly.  Also, the cells in an NICH do not have glucose receptors, whereas the cells of almost all hemangiomas do have glucose receptors.  Finally, NICH is different from more common types of hemangiomas because NICH does not spontaneously disappear (involute). Instead, NICH remains stable over time."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What are signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome? 48,XXYY affects various body systems including disruption of male sexual development. Adolescent and adult males with this condition typically have small testes that do not produce enough testosterone, which is the hormone that directs male sexual development. A shortage of testosterone during puberty can lead to reduced facial and body hair, poor muscle development, low energy levels, and an increased risk for breast enlargement (gynecomastia). Because their testes do not function normally, males with 48, XXYY syndrome have an inability to father children (infertility). 48,XXYY syndrome can affect other parts of the body as well. Males with 48,XXYY syndrome are often taller than other males their age. They tend to develop a tremor that typically starts as a young adult and worsens with age. Dental problems are frequently seen with this condition; they include delayed appearance of the primary (baby) or secondary (adult) teeth, thin tooth enamel, crowded and/or misaligned teeth, and multiple cavities. As affected males get older, they may develop a narrowing of the blood vessels in the legs, called peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease can cause skin ulcers to form. Affected males are also at risk for developing a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that occurs in the deep veins of the legs. Additionally, males with 48,XXYY syndrome may have flat feet (pes planus), elbow abnormalities, allergies, asthma, type 2 diabetes, seizures, and congenital heart defects. Most males with 48,XXYY syndrome have some degree of difficulty with speech and language development. Learning disabilities, especially reading problems, are very common in males with this disorder. Affected males seem to perform better at tasks focused on math, visual-spatial skills such as puzzles, and memorization of locations or directions. Some boys with 48,XXYY syndrome have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking that can lead to poor coordination. Affected males have higher than average rates of behavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); mood disorders, including anxiety and bipolar disorder; and/or autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction."

            "question": "What causes 48,XXYY syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes 48,XXYY? 48,XXYY syndrome is a condition related to the X and Y chromosomes (the sex chromosomes). People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). 48,XXYY syndrome results from the presence of an extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male's cells (48,XXYY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the pseudoautosomal regions of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome; however, the specific genes have not been identified.[5209]"

            "answer": "Juvenile osteoporosis is a condition of bone demineralization characterized by pain in the back and extremities, multiple fractures, difficulty walking, and evidence of osteoporosis. Symptoms typically develop just before puberty. Osteoporosis is rare in children and adolescents. When it does occur, it is usually caused by an underlying medical disorder or by medications used to treat the disorder. This is called secondary osteoporosis. Sometimes, however, there is no identifiable cause of osteoporosis in a child. This is known as idiopathic osteoporosis. There is no established medical or surgical therapy for juvenile osteoporosis. In some cases, treatment is not necessary, as the condition resolves spontaneously. Early diagnosis may allow for preventive steps, including physical therapy, avoidance of weight-bearing activities, use of crutches and other supportive care. A well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is also important. In severe, long-lasting cases, medications such as bisphosphonates may be used. In most cases, complete recovery of bone occurs."

            "answer": "How might steatocystoma multiplex be treated? Treatment options for steatocystoma multiplex are limited and have had varying degrees of success. The most effective treatment method is thought to be removal of cysts by surgery.  However, cosmetic concerns, time, cost, and pain need to be considered because affected individuals often have multiple cysts.  In many cases, small incisions (cuts into the skin) allow the cyst and its contents to be removed through the opening.  Other treatment options include medications such as oral isotretinoin to temporarily shrink the cysts and reduce inflammation or oral antibiotics to reduce redness and swelling.  Other procedures may include draining cysts through a procedure called aspiration, liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, dermabrasion, and carbon dioxide laser therapy. In a recently published case study, the authors present a case in which an individual with steatocystomas on the abdomen and lower chest showed substantial clearance of cysts after two laser treatment sessions. Future studies with a larger patient population will be helpful to evaluate this noninvasive treatment option and determine ideal treatment settings, number of treatments, and interval between treatments. This may prove to be an option for individuals with numerous cysts, in whom removal and drainage is not a realistic choice and other treatments have failed to improve the condition."

            "answer": "What causes uncombable hair syndrome? The stiffness of the hair in uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is likely due to the triangular shape of the hair shaft that is seen in cross section in affected people. It has been suggested that the condition may result from premature keratinization (development of keratin) of the inner root sheath, which forms the channel for the growing hair. The inner root sheath conforms in configuration to the abnormal outline of the hair shaft. It thus forms an irregular, rigid tube that then alters the shape of the emerging hair. While it is assumed that the condition is autosomal dominant and thus due to changes (mutations) in a gene, no responsible gene has been identified."

            "question": "Is Uncombable hair syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is uncombable hair syndrome inherited? Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Autosomal dominant means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. Reduced penetrance means that not all people with a mutation in the responsible gene will have the condition. For this reason, conditions with reduced penetrance may appear to \"skip a generation\" or may appear to occur for the first time (or only once) in a family. While people with UHS often report a negative family history, the characteristic hair shaft abnormality seen in affected people can still be seen in unaffected family members by looking at their hair under a specific type of microscope."

            "answer": "How might uncombable hair syndrome be treated? There is no definitive treatment for uncombable hair syndrome, but the condition usually improves or resolves on its own with the onset of puberty. Gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. These strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective. Another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use of biotin supplements. One case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation."

            "question": "What is (are) Cornelia de Lange syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms can vary widely, but may include distinctive facial characteristics, growth delays, intellectual disability and limb defects. Approximately 65% of people affected by CdLS have a change (mutation) in the NIPBL gene. Another 5% of cases are caused by mutations in one of four known genes: SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8 and RAD21. In the remaining 30% of cases, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown. CdLS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC2, or RAD21) or X-linked (SMC1A or HDAC8) manner. However, most cases result from new (de novo) mutations and occur in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."

An additional 5% of people affected by the condition have mutations in one of four known genes (SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8 and RAD21). Many of the genes associated with CdLS encode proteins that play an important role in human development before birth. Mutations in these genes may result in an abnormal protein that is not able to carry out its normal function. This is thought to interfere with early development leading to the many signs and symptoms of CdLS. In 30% of people with CdLS, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown."

As a result, these materials accumulate in cells leading to the various signs and symptoms of the condition. Most people with mucolipidosis type 4 develop severe psychomotor (mental and motor skills) delay by the end of the first year of life and visual impairment that worsens over time. Other common features of the condition include limited or absent speech; intellectual disability; hypotonia that gradually progresses to spasticity; problems controlling hand movements; impaired production of stomach acids; and iron deficiency. Approximately 5% of affected people have a mild form of the condition (known as atypical mucolipidosis type 4) which is associated with milder psychomotor delay and less severe eye abnormalities.

Other known causes of vitamin B12 malabsorption must then be ruled out. Lastly, it must be shown that after correcting the deficiency, the only nutrient to be poorly absorbed is vitamin B12. The diagnosis can also be confirmed by having genetic testing of the genes that are known to cause the condition.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I? Signs and symptoms of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 tend to become evident between the ages of 10 to 30 years. Symptoms include multiple, tiny, hard rounded bumps of thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The bumps may join to form calluses on pressure points. The legions may cause pain, making walking difficult and impairing hand/finger movement. Symptoms tend to worsen with time and may be aggravated by manual work or injury. In some families, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 appears to be associated with an increased risk for several types of cancer. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Lymphoma 50% Neoplasm of the breast 50% Neoplasm of the colon 50% Neoplasm of the pancreas 50% Renal neoplasm 50% Abnormality of the nail 7.5% Abnormality of the skin - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Heterogeneous - Late onset - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "answer": "What causes palmoplantar keratoderma type 1? Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 is a condition that is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in the AAGAB gene in several families. Although the exact function of the AAGAB gene is currently unknown, the gene is thought to play an important role in skin integrity."

            "question": "Is Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I inherited? Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal dominant inheritance is when only one mutated copy of a disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient for a person to be affected. An autosomal dominant condition may occur for the first time in an affected individual due to a new mutation, or may be inherited from an affected parent. When a person with an autosomal dominant disorder has a child, there is a 50% chance that his/her child will inherit the condition. Keratosis palmoplantaris papulosa shows age dependent penetrance and possibly variable penetrance as well. Age dependant penetrance means that the older the person is, the more likely they are to develop symptoms if they have inherited the disease causing gene mutation. Variable penetrance means that not everyone who inherits the gene mutation that causes keratosis palmoplantaris papulosa develops the signs and symptoms of the condition. However this person would still be at risk of passing the disease-causing mutation to their offspring."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I ?",
            "answer": "How might punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 be treated? Treatment options for this condition generally include topical salicylic acid, mechanical debridement, excision, and systemic retinoids. These therapies can lead to a temporary decrease in skin thickness and softening of the skin. Unfortunately, in many cases, medical and surgical treatment for punctate keratodermas do not provide consistent or long-lasting results. In general, there has been some reported success using keratolytics such as corticosteroids, urea, salicylic acid, lactic acid, or Vitamin A. Systemic therapy using vitamin D analogues, aromatic retinoids, and 5-fluorouracil has also been used. However, individuals with successful resolution of lesions often relapse unless they are maintained on chronic low-dose therapy. These topical and systemic treatments carry a variety of side effects. Surgery (including excision and skin grafting) for punctate keratodermas has been used on lesions resistant to medical treatment, but healing after surgical treatment can be difficult. CO2 laser ablation has also been attempted and reportedly produces good results for limited areas of hyperkeratosis of the palms."

            "question": "What is (are) Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease ?",
            "answer": "Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are a group of diseases of the blood and bone marrow in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells.  These disease have features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. In myelodysplastic diseases, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets and as a result, there are fewer of these healthy cells. In myeloproliferative diseases, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells develop into one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases. The 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); and atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML). When a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC). Symptoms of CMML and JMML may include fever, feeling tired and weight loss. Symptoms of aCML may include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired or weak. Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases may progress to acute leukemia. There are different types of treatment for individuals with one of these diseases, which may include chemotherapy, another drug therapy, stem cell transplant and/or supportive care."

In most cases, the cause of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease is unknown, and there is limited information regarding potential causes. No specific genetic defects have been identified for any of the diseases. The specific cause of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is unknown, but exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens (agents that can cause cancer), ionizing radiation, and cytotoxic agents (agents that are toxic to cells) have been associated in some cases. The cause of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is not known; however, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk for developing JMML, and up to 14% of cases of JMML occur in children with NF1. Atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML) has been associated with cytogenetic (chromosomal) abnormalities in as many as 80% of individuals with the disease; however, no cytogenetic abnormality is specific. Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/ MPN-UC) (also known as mixed myeloproliferative/ myelodysplastic syndrome) also has no known cause."

            "question": "What is (are) Bronchiolitis obliterans ?",
            "answer": "Bronchiolitis obliterans is an inflammatory obstruction of the lung's tiniest airways, the bronchioles. The bronchioles may become damaged and inflamed after inhalation of toxic fumes, as a result of respiratory infections, in association with connective tissue disorders, or after bone marrow or heart-lung transplants. This leads to extensive scarring that blocks the airways, leading to a dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and wheezing in the absence of a cold or asthma. While there is no way to reverse the disease, treatments are available to stabilize or slow the progression.   Another similarly named disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, is a completely different disease."

            "answer": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) occurs when your immune system makes antibodies that attack your red blood cells. This causes a drop in the number of red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. Symptoms may include unusual weakness and fatigue with tachycardia and breathing difficulties, jaundice, dark urine and/or splenomegaly. AIHA can be primary (idiopathic) or result from an underlying disease or medication. The condition may develop gradually or occur suddenly. There are two main types of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: warm antibody hemolytic anemia and cold antibody hemolytic anemia.

In general, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is characterized by skin spots (nevi) that may be few to hundreds in number. Size tends varies from millimeters to several centimeters in length. These nevi are made of blood vessels and are spongy, meaning they can easily be pressed upon.  When pressure is released, they refill with blood and regain their original shape.  They tend to be blue but can vary in color and shape. The surface of the nevi may be smooth or wrinkled and they often have a rubbery feel. They do not tend to bleed spontaneously, but are fragile and will bleed if injured. They may be tender to the touch. They may also be associated with increased sweating in the area of the skin legions. The number and size of legions may worsen with advancing age.  Nevi may also be found in the intestines (particularly the small intestine) in individuals with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. These nevi can bleed spontaneously causing anemia. Most bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is slow; however, sudden quick bleeding (hemorrhage) is possible. Other serious complications of gastrointestinal legions may include intussusception, bowel infarction, and even death. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome can affect other body organs as well.  Nevi have been reported in the skull, central nervous system, thyroid, parotid, eyes, mouth, lungs, pleura, pericardium, musculoskeletal system, peritoneal cavity, mesentery, kidney, liver, spleen, penis, vulva, and bladder.  Nevi may also put pressure on joints, bones, or feet, which may make walking difficult or limit range of motion.

            "question": "What is (are) Multiple sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brain and the spinal cord. The disorder is characterized by destruction of the myelin, the fatty tissue that surrounds and protects the nerve fibers and promotes the transmission of nerve impulses, and damage to nerve cells. The symptoms vary widely from person to person, and may include sensory disturbances in the limbs, problems with muscle control, tremors, muscle stiffness (spasticity), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weakness, difficulty walking, poor bladder control, and vision problems. Most patients have periods during which they have symptoms (clinical attacks). The clinical attacks are typically followed by periods without any symptoms (remission). After several years, the symptoms worsen continuously. Multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder but the exact cause is unknown. Risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis include genetic factors like changes in the HLA-DRB1 gene and in the IL7R gene and environmental factors, such as exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, low levels of vitamin D, and smoking. The goal of treatment of MS is to decrease attacks and the inflammation within the central nervous system."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Multiple sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple sclerosis? The peak age of onset is between ages 20 and 40, although it may develop in children and has also been identified in individuals over 60 years of age. The most common signs and symptoms include sensory disturbance of the limbs; partial or complete visual loss; acute and subacute motor dysfunction of the limbs; diplopia (double vision); and gait dysfunction. These signs and symptoms may occur alone or in combination, and have to be present for a minimum of 24 hours to be considered a \"clinical attack.\" The signs and symptoms in individuals with MS are extremely variable, even among affected relatives within families. Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months. These episodes alternate with periods of reduced or no symptoms (remissions). While it is common for the disease to return (relapse), the disease may continue to get worse without periods of remission. Because nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged, patients with multiple sclerosis can have symptoms in many parts of the body. Muscle symptoms may include loss of balance, muscle spasms, numbness or abnormal sensation in any area, problems moving arms or legs, problems walking, problems with coordination and making small movements, and tremor or weakness in one or more arms or legs. Bowel and bladder symptoms may include constipation and stool leakage, difficulty beginning to urinate, frequent need or strong urge to urinate, and incontinence. Eye symptoms may include double vision, eye discomfort, uncontrollable rapid eye movements, and vision loss. There may be numbness, tingling, or pain in the face, muscles, arms or legs. Other brain and nerve symptoms may include decreased attention span, poor judgment, and memory loss; difficulty reasoning and solving problems; depression or feelings of sadness; dizziness and balance problems; and hearing loss. Individuals may also have slurred or difficult-to-understand speech, trouble chewing and swallowing, and sexual symptoms such as problems with erections or vaginal lubrication.

            "question": "What causes Multiple sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "What causes multiple sclerosis? Studies suggest that there are many factors that influence whether a person will develop multiple sclerosis (MS). The factors that contribute to its onset are multiple and may vary from person to person. The signs and symptoms of MS occur as a result of inflammation, loss of the protective nerve covering (myelin), and the breakdown of nerve cells. The most widely accepted theory is that MS begins as an autoimmune disorder, where white blood cells (lymphocytes) attack healthy tissues. Later, signs and symptoms occur as a result of abnormal activity of specific cells in the brain and spinal cord (microglial cells) and progressive injury and loss of brain and spinal cord cells. Additional theories regarding the cause of MS include chronic viral infections and genetic disease. Although many viruses, and particularly the Epstein-Barr virus, have been associated with MS, there is no specific evidence linking viruses directly to the development of MS. Still, Epstein-Barr virus infection is considered a risk factor for the disease. Certain gene changes, including ones in HLA-DRB1 are associated with an increased risk for developing multiple sclerosis. However, it is unclear exactly what role these gene changes play in the development of MS. Having a first-degree relative with MS, like a parent or sibling, does increase a persons risk for the condition (to around 2%). Learn more about gene changes and MS. Vitamin D is another area of interest. Those who are exposed to more sunlight tend to have higher levels of naturally-produced vitamin D, which is thought to support the immune function and may help protect against immune-mediated diseases like MS. Further information on the cause of MS is available at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Web site."

            "question": "How to diagnose Multiple sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed? Symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) may be similar to those of many other nervous system disorders. The disease is made based on the person's signs and symptoms and is typically diagnosed by ruling out other conditions. \"Dissemination in time and space\" are commonly-used criteria for diagnosing the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RR-MS). \"Dissemination in time means\" that there are at least two clinical attacks, each lasting at least 24 hours, separated by at least one month, or a slow, step-wise progressive course for at least six months. \"Dissemination in space\" means that there are lesions in more than one area of the brain or spinal cord. For primary progressive MS (PP-MS), there are currently no diagnostic criteria that are universally accepted. Physicians may do many tests to evaluate an individual suspected of having MS. Neurological Exam: May show reduced nerve function in one area of the body or over many parts of the body. This may include abnormal nerve reflexes, decreased ability to move a part of the body, decreased or abnormal sensation, and other loss of nervous system functions. Eye Exam: May show abnormal pupil responses, changes in the visual fields or eye movements, decreased visual acuity, problems with the inside parts of the eye, and rapid eye movements triggered when the eye moves. Other Tests: Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid tests, MRI scan of the brain, MRI scan of the spine; nerve function study; and several of blood tests. The Revised McDonald Criteria, published In 2010 by the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, include specific guidelines for using MRI, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis to speed the diagnostic process."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? There are six major types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Although there is significant overlap in associated features, the subtypes are classified based on their unique signs and symptoms: Hypermobility type - characterized primarily by joint hypermobility affecting both large (elbows, knees) and small (fingers, toes) joints which may lead to recurrent joint dislocations and subluxations (partial dislocation). Affected people generally experience skin involvement (soft, smooth and velvety skin with easy bruising) and chronic pain of the muscles and/or bones, as well. Classic type - associated with extremely elastic (stretchy), smooth skin that is fragile and bruises easily; wide, atrophic scars (flat or depressed scars); and joint hypermobility. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas over pressure points such as the elbow) and spheroids (fat-containing cysts on forearms and shins) are frequently diagnosed in affected people. Hypotonia and delayed motor development may occur, as well. Vascular type - characterized by thin, translucent skin that is extremely fragile and bruises easily. Arteries and certain organs such as the intestines and uterus are also fragile and prone to rupture. Affected people typically have short stature; thin scalp hair; and characteristic facial features including large eyes, a thin nose and lobeless ears. Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include club foot; tendon and/or muscle rupture; acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet); early onset varicose veins; pneumothorax (collapse of a lung); gingival (gums) recession; and a decreased amount of subcutaneous (under the skin) fat. Kyphoscoliosis type - associated with severe hypotonia at birth, delayed motor development, progressive scoliosis (present from birth), and scleral fragility. Affected people may also have easy bruising; fragile arteries that are prone to rupture; unusually small cornia; and osteopenia (low bone density). Other common features include a \"marfanoid habitus\" which is characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly); unusually long limbs; and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Arthrochalasia type - characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation. Other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising; hypotonia; kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis); and mild osteopenia. Dermatosparaxis type - associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; and hernias.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be caused by changes (mutations) in several different genes (COL5A1, COL5A2, COL1A1, COL3A1, TNXB, PLOD1, COL1A2, and ADAMTS2). However, the underlying genetic cause is unknown in some families. Mutations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, and/or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs resulting in the features of the disorder."

            "question": "Is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome inherited? The inheritance pattern of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) varies by subtype. The arthrochalasia, classic, hypermobility, and vascular forms of the disorder usually have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with one of these subtypes has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. The dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis types of EDS are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

Depending on the subtype suspected, some of the following tests may be ordered to support the diagnosis: Collagen typing performed on a skin biopsy may aid in the diagnosis of vascular type, arthrochalasia type, and dermatosparaxis type. Collagen is a tough, fiber-like protein that makes up about a third of body protein. It is part of the structure of tendons, bones, and connective tissues. People with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often have abnormalities of certain types of collagen. Genetic testing is available for many subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; however, it is not an option for most families with the hypermobility type. Imaging studies such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and angiography may be useful in identifying certain features of the condition. Urine tests to detect deficiencies in certain enzymes that are important for collagen formation may be helpful in diagnosing kyphoscoliosis type."

            "question": "What is (are) Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?",
            "answer": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited condition characterized by the accumulation of fats called sulfatides in cells, especially cells of the nervous system. This accumulation results in progressive destruction of white matter of the brain, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Affected individuals experience progressive deterioration of intellectual functions and motor skills, such as the ability to walk. They also develop loss of sensation in the extremities, incontinence, seizures, paralysis, inability to speak, blindness, and hearing loss. Eventually they lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the ARSA and PSAP genes."

            "question": "Is Metachromatic leukodystrophy inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is metachromatic leukodystrophy inherited? Metachromatic leukodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals inherit two copies of each gene - one copy from each parent. Typically, an individual is affected because they inherited a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. Individuals with one mutated copy of the gene (such as an unaffected parent of an affected individual) are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

            "question": "How to diagnose Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?",
            "answer": "Who might consider genetic carrier testing for a family history of metachromatic leukodystrophy? If someone has a family history of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or someone is known to be a carrier for MLD, individuals who are biologically related to the affected individual or carrier are at risk to be a carrier. Generally speaking, the more closely related an individual is to the affected individual or carrier, the greater the chance for that person to be a carrier. Prior to genetic testing, the chance to be a carrier for some biological relatives of an affected individual are as follows: Parent of affected individual: assumed to be 100% (called an obligate carrier) Unaffected sibling of affected individual: 2 in 3 (~66.6%) Aunt or uncle of affected individual: 1 in 2 (50%) First cousin of affected individual: 1 in 4 (25%) If someone has carrier testing and is found to be negative (not a carrier), that person's children are typically assumed to be negative also. More information about the use of genetic carrier testing is available on GeneTests' Web site and can be viewed by clicking here. Individuals who are interested in learning about genetic testing and about their specific risk to be a carrier should speak with a genetics professional."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Churg Strauss syndrome? The specific signs and symptoms of Churg Strauss syndrome (CSS) vary from person to person depending on the organ systems involved. The severity, duration and age of onset also vary. CSS is considered to have three distinct phases - prodromal (allergic), eosinophilic and vasculitic - which don't always occur sequentially. Some people do not develop all three phases. The prodromal (or allergic) phase is characterized by various allergic reactions. Affected people may develop asthma (including a cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath); hay fever (allergic rhinitis); and/or repeated episodes of sinusitis. This phase can last from months to many years. Most people develop asthma-like symptoms before any other symptoms. The eosinophilic phase is characterized by accumulation of eosinophils (a specific type of white blood cell) in various tissues of the body - especially the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and skin. The vasculitic phase is characterized by widespread inflammation of various blood vessels (vasculitis). Chronic vasculitis can cause narrowing of blood vessels, which can block or slow blood flow to organs. Inflamed blood vessels can also become thin and fragile (potentially rupturing) or develop a bulge (aneurysm). People with CSS often develop nonspecific symptoms including fatigue, fever, weight loss, night sweats, abdominal pain, and/or joint and muscle pain. Neurological symptoms (such as pain, tingling or numbness) are common and depend on the specific nerves involved. About half of affected people develop skin abnormalities due to accumulation of eosinophils in skin tissue. Symptoms of skin involvement may include purplish skin lesions, a rash with hives, and/or small bumps, especially on the elbows. Gastrointestinal involvement may cause various symptoms also. Heart problems may include inflammation of heart tissues and in severe cases, heart failure. The kidneys can also become involved, eventually causing glomerulonephritis.

Although this condition usually begins in a person's teens or twenties, rare cases may appear in early childhood or later in adulthood.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy? Blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of this disorder. These vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens, often leading to severe loss of sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. This condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In rare cases, other symptoms may occur such as heart arrhythmias and neurologic abnormalities (e.g., postural tremor, peripheral neuropathy, nonspecific myopathy, movement disorders), and a multiple sclerosis-like disorder. However, a significant percentage of people with a mutation that causes Leber hereditary optic neuropathy do not develop any features of the disorder. Specifically, more than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related medical problems. Additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies of these factors have produced conflicting results. Researchers are also investigating whether changes in additional genes, particularly genes on the X chromosome, contribute to the development of signs and symptoms.

            "answer": "What causes Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)? Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes cause LHON. These genes are contained in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). The genes related to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function. These proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

The gene mutations that cause this condition are found in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are inherited from a person's mother, and as a result, only females pass mitochondrial conditions on to their children. Men can be affected, but they cannot pass the condition on to their children. Often, people who develop the features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy have no family history of the condition. Because a person may carry a mitochondrial DNA mutation without experiencing any signs or symptoms, it is hard to predict which members of a family who carry a mutation will eventually develop vision loss or other medical problems associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. It is important to note that all females with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, even those who do not have any signs or symptoms, will pass the genetic change to their children."

Affected people usually develop moderate visual loss and color vision defects. The severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. About 20% of people with DOA have non-ocular features, such as sensorineural hearing loss; myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs). These cases may be referred to as 'DOA plus.' DOA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a mutation in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified. There is currently no way to prevent or cure DOA, but affected people may benefit from low vision aids."

            "question": "Is Dominant optic atrophy inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is dominant optic atrophy inherited? Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from a parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in an affected person and is not inherited from a parent (a de novo mutation). When a person with a mutation that causes DOA has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. While a mutation responsible for DOA can cause the condition, not all people with a mutation will develop DOA. This means that DOA has reduced penetrance. There are likely to be other genetic and environmental factors that influence whether a person with a mutation will develop features of DOA. Additionally, not all people who do develop features will be affected the same way, and severity can vary - even within families. This phenomenon is known as variable expressivity. People with questions about genetic risks or genetic testing for themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional."

Management generally consists of regular eye exams, including measurement of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Currently there is no specific treatment, but low-vision aids in individuals with severely decreased visual acuity can be helpful. A preliminary study published in February 2013 found that several individuals with specific OPA1 mutations who underwent idebenone therapy (which has been used to treat some cases of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) experienced some improvement of visual function. However, more thorough research is necessary to confirm these findings. Acupuncture is also being studied as a potential treatment. Avoiding tobacco and alcohol intake and certain medications (antibiotics, antivirals), which can interfere with mitochondrial metabolism, may help to slow the progression. Cochlear implants have been shown to markedly improve hearing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss."

When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% (1 in 4) chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier"

            "question": "What is (are) Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 2 ?",
            "answer": "Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a group of eye disorders that affects the development of the eye. Common eye symptoms include cornea defects, which is the clear covering on the front of the eye, and iris defects, which is the colored part of the eye. People with this syndrome may have an off-center pupil (corectopia) or extra holes in the eyes that can look like multiple pupils (polycoria). About 50% of people with this syndrome develop glaucoma, which is a serious condition that increases pressure inside of the eye. This may cause vision loss or blindness. Click here to view a diagram of the eye.  Even though Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, this syndrome is also associated with symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Most people with this syndrome have distinctive facial features and many have issues with their teeth, including unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia). Some people have extra folds of skin around their belly button, heart defects, or other more rare birth defects. There are three types of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and each has a different genetic cause. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 1 is caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in the PITX2 gene. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 3 is caused by mutations in the FOXC1 gene. The gene that causes Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 2 is not known, but it is located on chromosome 13. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."

This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Usually only one eye is affected. Some people with Duane syndrome develop amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye. Most cases occur without other signs and symptoms. There are three forms of Duane syndrome, designated types 1, 2, and 3. The types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). All three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward and are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Acute intermittent porphyria? Some people who inherit the gene for AIP never develop symptoms and are said to have \"latent\" AIP. Those individuals that present with symptoms usually do so after puberty, probably because of hormonal influences, although other activating factors include: alcohol, drugs (e.g., barbiturates, steroids, sulfa-containing antibiotics), chemicals, smoking, reduced caloric intake, stress, and travel. Symptoms usually last several days, but attacks for which treatment is not received promptly may last weeks or months. Abdominal pain, which is associated with nausea and can be severe, is the most common symptom and usually the first sign of an attack. Other symptoms may include :  Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, ileus)  Urinary tract issues (e.g., urinary retention, urinary incontinence, or dysuria)  Neurological issues (e.g., muscle weakness in the arms or legs, paralysis)  Psychiatric issues (e.g., insomnia, hysteria, anxiety, apathy or depression, phobias, psychosis, agitation, delirium, somnolence, or coma) Individuals with AIP have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma; some develop kidney failure.

AIP is caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) and formerly known as uroporphyrinogen I-synthase. The deficiency of PBGD is caused by a mutation in the HMBS gene. The HMBS gene is the only gene known to be associated with AIP. However, the deficiency of PBGD alone is not enough to cause AIP. Other activating factors (e.g., hormones, drugs, dietary changes) must also be present."

            "answer": "How is acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) diagnosed? Diagnosis of AIP is suspected in individuals with otherwise unexplained severe, acute abdominal pain without physical signs. The finding of increased levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) in urine establishes that one of the acute porphyrias is present. If PBGD is deficient in normal red blod cells, the diagnosis of AIP is established. The diagnosis is confirmed in individuals with a disease-causing mutation in the HMBS gene, the only gene known to be associated with AIP, which encodes the erythrocyte hydroxymethylbilane synthase enzyme. Molecular genetic testing of the HMBS gene detects more than 98% of affected individuals and is available in clinical laboratories.

Treatment may include stopping medications that cause or worsen the symptoms, treating any infections which may be present, administration of pain medication, monitoring fluid balance and/or correcting electrolyte disturbances, monitoring neurologic status and administering respiratory support. Mild attacks can be manged with increased caloric intake and fluid replacement. Recurrent acute attacks should be managed by a porphyria specialist. Hospitalization is often necessary.  Panhematin, an intravenous medication used to correct heme deficiency, may also be prescribed.

Since only a small number of individuals with this microduplication have been reported, the full range of effects is still being discovered. What is known is that the symptoms are variable, even between members of the same family. While some people with this microduplication do not have symptoms, several features seem to be common, including delayed development, intellectual disability, communication difficulties, emotional and behavioral problems (including autistic spectrum disorders), insomnia, and seizures. 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome is caused by a tiny duplication (microduplication) on the long arm of chromosome 15 that spans at least 6 genes. The features of this syndrome are thought to be caused by the presence of three copies of the genes in this region, instead of the normal two. However, it is unclear which genes contribute to the specific features. In addition, it is likely that other genetic or environmental factors influence the symptoms seen in this condition. Some cases of 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Other cases are new (de novo). Treatment typically focuses on treating the symptoms (such as medication for seizures)."

Some mutations in the SALL1 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the SALL1 protein that malfunctions within the cell. Other mutations prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from making any protein. It is unclear how these genetic changes disrupt normal development and cause the  symptoms associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome."

            "answer": "Is Townes-Brocks syndrome genetic? Yes. Townes-Brocks syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In about 50% of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. The other 50% have the condition as a result of a new (de novo) mutation."

PKAN is generally separated into classic and atypical forms. Children with classic PKAN develop symptoms in the first ten years of life. The atypical form of PKAN usually occurs after the age of ten and progresses more slowly. All individuals with PKAN have an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change, called the eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this disorder.

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration? There are two forms of PKAN, classical and atypical. Symptoms of classic PKAN develop during early childhood, usually before age 10. The first symptom is often difficutly with movement and walking. Children are often first considered clumsy as their legs can be rigid, dystonic (an abnormality of muscle tone) and have involuntary muscle spasms (spasticity); these symptoms worsen over time.  People can plateau for long periods of time and then undergo intervals of rapid deterioration, often lasting one to two months. Children usually lose the ability to walk by 10-15 years after the beginning of symptoms.  Many individuals also experience limited speech and may have enough trouble with chewing and swallowing that a feeding tube becomes necessary. Two-thirds of children with classical PKAN develop peripheral (side) vision loss and night blindness due to retinal degeneration. Cognitive functioning varies from person to person and can range from high average to below average. Premature death does occur; however, live span is variable. With improvements in medical care, a greater number of affected individuals are living into adulthood. All individuals with PKAN have an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change, called the eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this disorder. Features of the atypical form usually progress more slowly and appear within the first three decades of life. Signs and symptoms vary, but the progression in the atypical form is usually slower. Symptoms are usually marked by speech difficulty such repetition of words or phrases (palilalia), rapid speech (tachylalia), and poor articulation/slurring (dysarthria). Psychiatric symptoms such as behavioral problems, personality changes, and depression are more commonly observed. While movement problems are a common feature, it usually develops later. Loss of independent walking often occurs 15-40 years after the initial development of symptoms. Retinal degeneration is rare in the atypical form.

Treatment consists of medications and surgery to relieve symptoms. For many of the treatments that do improve symptoms, the period of benefit is limited. Baclofen and trihexyphenidyl remain the most effective drugs for the dystonia and spasticity associated with this condition. Botulinum toxin may be helpful for many affected individuals, especially in treating a limited body region. For example, injections in the facial muscles can greatly improve speech and eating abilities. Those with PKAN typically do not benefit from L-dopa. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is also an option for relieving some symptoms; an international study of the effectiveness of DBS is currently underway. Recently, interest in chelating agents (agents that remove iron from the body) has also been revived, although the benefits have not yet been documented and systemic anemia remains a risk.

            "question": "What causes Mosaic trisomy 9 ?",
            "answer": "What causes mosaic trisomy 9? Most cases of mosaic trisomy 9 occur due to a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) or after fertilization has taken place. An error in cell division (called nondisjunction) may cause some eggs or sperm to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. If an egg or sperm with an extra chromosome 9 contributes to the genetic makeup of an embryo, the embryo will have an extra copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. As the embryo grows and divides, an attempt may be made to correct the mistake by eliminating one extra chromosome 9. In people with mosaic trisomy 9, this attempt may be partly successful, leaving some cells with an extra chromosome 9 and some cells with the extra chromosome deleted (the usual chromosome number). This correction process is called trisomy rescue. In other cases, the egg and sperm may have a normal number of chromosomes, but an error of cell division (nondisjunction) occurs when the fertilized egg is growing and dividing. If an error occurs during one of the divisions, it can cause some cells to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In people affected by mosaic trisomy 9, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 9, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome (trisomy). The percentage of cells with trisomy 9 and which parts of the body are affected vary from person to person. This leads to variability in the range and severity of symptoms. In rare cases, mosaic trisomy 9 is inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement called a \"pericentric inversion.\" This occurs when a segment of chromosome 9 has broken off in two places, swiveled round 180 degrees and reinserted itself into the chromosome. If this rearrangement is considered \"balanced,\" meaning the piece of chromosome is in a different order but no genetic material is gained or lost, it usually does not cause any symptoms or health problems. However, it can be associated with an increased risk of having children with an abnormal number or chromosomes."

            "answer": "How is mosaic trisomy 9 diagnosed? In some cases, mosaic trisomy 9 is diagnosed before birth. A pregnancy ultrasound may reveal signs and symptoms that are suggestive of a chromosomal or developmental disorder. Additional tests, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or an amniocentesis, may be offered to further investigate these features. During a CVS, a tissue sample from a portion of the placenta is removed and analyzed, while amniocentesis involves the removal of a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing baby. In both tests, the fluid or tissue sample is used to obtain a picture of the baby's chromosomes, which is called a karyotype. This may reveal mosaic trisomy 9. In other cases, the child is not diagnosed until after birth. Mosaic trisomy 9 may be suspected after characteristic signs and symptoms are identified on physical exam. A diagnosis can be confirmed by examining the child's chromosomes from a sample of blood."

Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children with bone or muscle abnormalities and/or delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Depending on the degree of intellectual disability, a child may require special education classes. Heart defects and cleft lip and/or palate may need to be surgically repaired. Children with hydrocephalus may be treated with certain medications and/or shunting (placement of a specialized device that drains excess fluid away from the brain). Other surgeries may be recommended depending on the nature and severity of the other features (i.e. craniofacial, muscular, skeletal, kidney, and/or reproductive system problems) and their associated symptoms."

            "answer": "What causes split hand foot malformation? Split hand foot malformation may occur as an isolated feature or it may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Researchers believe that a large number of mutations can cause split hand foot malformation. A few of which have been identified: FBXW4 and TP63. Most commonly the conditions are passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance. In autosomal dominant inheritance an affected parent would have a 1 in 2 or 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the genetic defect to his/her offspring. In conditions with reduced penetrance a person who inherits the underlying genetic defect, may never develop the condition. More rarely other forms of inheritance have been reported (e.g., autosomal-recessive, X-linked, chromosome deletions, chromosome duplications)."

            "answer": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue, which is the material between the cells of the body that gives tissues form and strength. The disorder primarily affects the skin, hair, and skeletal system. Symptoms usually show up by childhood or adolescence. Like people with other types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, individuals with the progeroid form have unusually flexible joints, loose elastic skin, and easy scarring. Features that are unique to this type include sparse scalp hair and eyebrows, and loose elastic skin on the face; these features cause affected individuals to look older than their age. Additional symptoms may include bone weakness, weak muscle tone, mild intellectual disability, and delayed growth in affected children. The progeroid type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by mutations in the B4GALT7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid type ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid type? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome refers to a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by stretchy or kneadable skin, double jointedness, and delayed healing of skin wounds. In addition to these traits, individuals with the progeroid type have thin curly hair, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, loose elastic skin on the face, and may also have uneven facial features. Although progeroid means \"appearance similar to old age\", individuals with progeroid Ehlers-Danlos syndrome do not actually have premature aging and are not expected to have a shortened life span. Other symptoms may include poor muscle tone, fragile bones from low bone mineral density, abnormal teeth, and infection of gums around the teeth. Children who are affected may have delayed growth, which can result in short stature as an adult (less than 152cm). Mild intellectual disabilities or learning disabilities have also been associated with this disorder. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

            "answer": "What causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type is caused by changes (mutations) in both of an individual's copies of the B4GALT7 gene, which is located on chromosome 5. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the production of collagen (the main protein in connective tissue). When not enough enzyme is made by the B4GALT7 genes, collagen is not formed correctly in connective tissue. The symptoms of the disorder are caused by weak connective tissue. Researchers are still studying exactly how mutations in the B4GALT7 gene cause the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type."

            "answer": "How is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type inherited? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that an individual must have two non-functional copies of the B4GALT7 gene to be affected with the condition. One copy is inherited from each parent. If an individual has only one non-functional B4GALT7 gene (such as each parent), he or she is a \"carrier\". Carriers do not typically show any signs or symptoms of a recessive condition. When two carriers for a recessive condition have children, with each pregnancy there is a 25% (1 in 4) risk for the child to be affected, a 50%  (1 in 2) risk for the child to be a carrier (like each parent) and a 25% risk that the child will be unaffected and also not be a carrier. An individual with a recessive condition will generally have unaffected children, except in the rare circumstance where his or her partner is a carrier of a nonfunctional B4GALT7 gene."

Affected newborns appear normal at birth, but may begin to experience neurological symptoms such as abnormal muscle tone; poor sucking and coordination; seizures; and delayed motor development. Without early, appropriate treatment, the condition can cause permanent intellectual disability and even death. BH4 deficiency is caused by mutations in any one of several genes including the GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR genes.

            "answer": "Are schwannomas inherited? Most schwannomas are not inherited. The vast majority of schwannomas occur by chance (sporadically) and as a single tumor. In these cases, people typically do not have affected family members. Around 5-10% of people develop multiple schwannomas. In these cases, the schwannomas may be due to an inherited condition which can be passed from parent to child. For example, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis are two conditions known to cause multiple schwannomas. Both of these conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with neurofibromatosis type 2 or schwannomatosis has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

However, genetic testing is an option for people with an inherited condition that predisposes to schwannomas such as certain types of neurofibromatosis (neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis). Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. It provides a list of laboratories performing genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How are schwannomas diagnosed? In addition to a complete physical exam and medical history, the following tests may be necessary to diagnose a schwannoma: x-ray, ultrasound, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some people may also need a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis."

The best treatment options for schwannoma depends on several factors, including the size and location of the tumor; whether the tumor is benign or malignant (cancerous); and the age and overall health of the affected person. For example, standard treatment for benign schwannomas is surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. People with malignant schwannomas may also be treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in addition to surgery.  Because there is a chance that a schwannoma may return following surgery or treatment, regular follow-up with physical examinations and imaging should be discussed with a physician."

This syndrome leads to developmental regression and causes a specific pattern, known as hypsarrhythmia (chaotic brain waves), on electroencephalography (EEG) testing. The infantile spasms usually begin in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months. The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs. Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Infantile spasms usually stop by age five, but may be replaced by other types of seizures. Many underlying disorders, such as birth injury, metabolic disorders, and genetic disorders can lead to these spasms, making it important to identify the underlying cause. In some children, no cause can be found."

A coronary artery spasm is a temporary, abrupt, and focal (restricted to one location) contraction of the muscles in the wall of an artery in the heart. This spasm constricts the artery, slowing or stoping blood flow. A prolonged spasm can cause chest pain, or even a heart attack (myocardial infarction)."

Early signs and symptoms of the condition include fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, and joint pain. As the condition progresses, affected people may experience heart problems, Bell's palsy, arthritis, abnormal muscle movement, speech problems and cognitive (thinking) abnormalities. Please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site for a more comprehensive list of symptoms. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Certain features of the condition, including whether or not an affected person will develop medication-resistant chronic arthritis, is thought to be influenced by genetic factors (certain human leukocyte antigen genes). Treatment generally includes antibiotics to address the bacterial infection and other medications (i.e. pain medications) to relieve symptoms."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Pyoderma gangrenosum ?",
            "answer": "How might pyoderma gangrenosum be treated? Although antibiotics are often prescribed prior to having a correct diagnosis (and may be continued if there is a secondary infection or surrounding cellulitis), antibiotics are generally not helpful for treating uncomplicated cases of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). The best documented treatments for PG are systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporin A. Smaller ulcers may be treated with strong topical steroid creams, steroid injections, special dressings, oral anti-inflammatory antibiotics, and/or other therapies. More severe PG typically requires immunosuppressive therapy (used to decrease the body's immune responses). Combinations of steroids with cytotoxic drugs may be used in resistant cases. There has reportedly been rapid improvement of PG with use of anti-tumor necrosis alpha therapy (such as infliximab), which is also used to treat Crohn's disease and other conditions. Skin transplants and/or the application of bioengineered skin is useful in selected cases as a complementary therapy to immunosuppressive treatment. The use of modern wound dressings is helpful to minimize pain and the risk of secondary infections. Treatment for PG generally does not involve surgery because it can result in enlargement of the ulcer; however, necrotic tissue (dying or dead tissue) should be gently removed. More detailed information about the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is available on eMedicine's Web site and can be viewed by clicking here."

            "answer": "Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE) is a specific type of ichthyosis mainly affecting the skin. Most infants with NBCIE are born with a tight, shiny covering on their skin, called a collodion membrane, which is typically shed within a few weeks. Other signs and symptoms include redness of the skin (erythroderma); fine, white scales on the skin; and thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of feet (palmoplantar keratoderma). Some people with NBCIE also have outward turning eyelids (ectropion); outward turning lips (eclabium); and nails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). NBCIE may be caused by mutations in any one of at least three genes: ALOX12B, ALOXE3 or NIPAL4. In some people with NBCIE, the cause of the disorder is unknown."

            "answer": "How might nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma be treated? There is currently no cure for nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). Treatment generally focuses on managing the specific signs and symptoms each individual has. For newborns, the most important goals are to provide a moist environment in an isolette, and to prevent and treat infections. Petrolatum-based creams and ointments are typically used to keep the skin soft and hydrated. As children age, keratolytic agents (agents that help the skin loosen and shed) such as alpha-hydroxy acid or urea preparations can be used to promote the peeling and thinning of the outer layer of the skin. For individuals with severe skin involvement, oral retinoid therapy may be recommended. However, because this is known to cause abnormalities in a developing fetus, it should be used with caution in women of child-bearing age. In general, any agents that irritate the skin should be avoided. Ectropion (turning out of the eyelid) can cause dryness of the cornea (especially at night), so artificial tears or prescription ointments may be used to keep the cornea moist.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Hypochondroplasia ?",
            "answer": "How might hypochondroplasia be treated? The evaluation of children with hypochondroplasia usually does not differ significantly from the evaluation of children with normal stature, except for genetic counseling issues (such as risk of recurrence) and dealing with parental concerns about short stature. Management of short stature may be influenced by the concerns and expectations of the parents. One reasonable approach is to address the parents' concerns about the height of their child rather than attempting to treat the child. Developmental intervention and special education may be appropriate, if it is indicated in the affected individual. If spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine) is present, a procedure called a laminectomy may be considered. This is a type of surgery that can take pressure off the spinal nerves or spinal canal. However, one study found that about 70% of symptomatic individuals with achondroplasia experienced total relief of symptoms following decompression, without having a laminectomy. Decompression is a less invasive procedure. Support groups can help the affected individual and the family adapt to short stature through peer support, personal example, and social awareness programs. Support groups may offer information on employment, education, disability rights, adoption of children of short stature, medical issues, suitable clothing, adaptive devices, and parenting through local meetings, workshops and seminars. To see the contact information for several support groups for hypochondroplasia, click here. Sometimes, for individuals with hypochondroplasia who are more severely affected, the features may overlap with those of achondroplasia. In these cases, recommendations for the management of achondroplasia (outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics) may be considered. The full report on these recommendations may be viewed here. For a more limited description of management of achondroplasia on our Web site, click here."

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the exact size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Some affected people appear to have no features or mild features, while others are more severely affected. Common symptoms shared by many people with this deletion include poor growth, developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, autism spectrum disorder, an unusually small head (microcephaly), and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."

            "answer": "What causes chromosome 3p- syndrome? In most people with chromosome 3p- syndrome, the deletion occurs as a new mutation (called a de novo mutation) and is not inherited from a parent. De novo mutations are due to a random error that occurs during the formation of egg or sperm cells, or shortly after conception. In a few cases, the deletion is inherited from a parent."

            "question": "Is Chromosome 3p- syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is chromosome 3p- syndrome inherited? In most cases, chromosome 3p- syndrome occurs for the first time in the affected person (de novo mutation). However, the deletion is rarely inherited from a parent. In these cases, the deletion is passed down in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that a person with chromosome 3p- syndrome has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the condition on to his or her child. In theory, it is possible for a parent to not have the deletion in their chromosomes on a blood test, but have the deletion in some of their egg or sperm cells only. This phenomenon is called germline mosaicism. In these rare cases, it would be possible to have another child with the deletion. To our knowledge, this has not been reported with chromosome 3p- syndrome. People interested in learning more about genetic risks to themselves or family members should speak with a genetics professional."

            "answer": "How is chromosome 3p- syndrome diagnosed? There are several different specialized tests that can be used to diagnose a chromosome 3p- syndrome. These include: Karyotype - a karyotype is a laboratory test that produces an image of a person's chromosomes. This test can be used to diagnose large deletions. FISH - a laboratory technique that is used to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence on a chromosome. During FISH, a chromosome is exposed to a small DNA sequence called a probe that has a fluorescent molecule attached to it. The probe sequence binds to its corresponding sequence on the chromosome. This test can be used in combination with karyotyping for deletions that are too small to be seen on karyotype, alone. However, FISH is only useful if the person ordering the test suspects there is a duplication of a specific region of 3p. Array CGH - a technology that detects deletions that are too small to be seen on karyotype."

Because chromosome 3p- syndrome affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this deletion varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, children with delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking) and/or muscle problems may be referred for physical or occupational therapy. Severe feeding difficulties may be treated temporarily with a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube to ensure that a baby or child gets enough nutrients. Certain medications may be prescribed to treat seizures. Special education services are often necessary for children with intellectual disability. Surgery may be required to treat certain physical abnormalities such as cleft palate or congenital heart defects, if present. Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan."

Very few cases of hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke (HERNS) have been reported. Based upon these reports, it appears that symptoms often begin in the 30s or 40s. Early symptoms, which may differ among individuals, may include depression, anxiety, paranoia, decreased central vision, and/or blind spots. Within the next 4 to 10 years affected individuals reportedly experience focal neurologic deficits that may have a sudden stroke-like onset. The stroke-like episodes may last several days. Headache and seizures may also occur. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include speech impairment, partial paralysis, and/or apraxia. Other symptoms of advanced disease include loss of vision as well as physical and mental skills. Kidney failure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria has been described in some affected individuals. Common to all affected individuals is the presence of cerebral microvasculopathic lesions. Some individuals go on to develop mass lesions, predominantly involving the right frontal lobe.

In people with this condition, hyperparathyroidism is caused by benign tumors (adenomas) that form in the parathyroid glands. About 15 percent of people with this condition develop a cancerous tumor called parathyroid carcinoma. About 25 to 50 percent of affected individuals can also develop a benign tumor called a fibroma in the jaw. Other benign or cancerous tumors can also develop, including tumors of the uterus in women; benign kidney cysts; and rarely, Wilms tumor. This condition is caused by mutations in the CDC73 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."

Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. Symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. There are six different types of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive."

            "question": "What is (are) Situs inversus ?",
            "answer": "Situs inversus is a condition in which the arrangement of the internal organs is a mirror image of normal anatomy. It can occur alone (isolated, with no other abnormalities or conditions) or it can occur as part of a syndrome with various other defects. Congenital heart defects are present in about 5-10% of affected people. The underlying cause and genetics of situs inversus are complex. Familial cases have been reported."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the symptoms of Situs inversus ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of situs inversus? In isolated situs inversus (occurring alone with no other abnormalities), there is a complete mirror image transposition of the thoracic (chest) and abdominal organs, and anterior-posterior (front-back) symmetry is normal. Many affected people have no associated health issues when the condition is isolated. When situs inversus occurs in association with other conditions such as Kartagener syndrome or primary ciliary dyskinesia, additional signs and symptoms relating to these conditions will be present."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is Situs inversus inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is situs inversus inherited? The genetics of situs inversus is complex. Several familial cases have been reported in which the inheritance has been described as either autosomal recessive (most commonly), autosomal dominant, or X-linked. The condition appears to be genetically heterogeneous, meaning that different genetic factors or genes may cause the condition among different people or families. If situs inversus is associated with another underlying syndrome or condition, the inheritance pattern may be the same as that of the underlying condition. People with questions about genetic risks to themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional."

        {
            "question": "How to diagnose Situs inversus ?",
            "answer": "How is situs inversus diagnosed? A thorough physical examination, followed by radiographic imaging of the chest and abdomen and electrocardiography, identify most cases of situs inversus. The main diagnostic challenge in affected people is the non-traditional presence of referred pain (pain felt in a different location than its source)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the treatments for Situs inversus ?",
            "answer": "How might situs inversus be treated? In isolated situs inversus, no treatment may be necessary. When situs inversus is associated with another condition, treatment may depend on the associated condition and the signs and symptoms present in the affected person. Knowing that a person has situs inversus is important for diagnosing medical problems and preventing surgical mishaps that can result from the failure to recognize reversed anatomy. For example, in a person with situs inversus, appendicitis causes pain in the left lower abdomen instead of the right lower abdomen. Wearing medical identification can help ensure proper treatment in an emergency medical situation."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Oral lichen planus ?",
            "answer": "How might oral lichen planus be treated? It is important to identify and remove any potential agent that might have caused a lichenoid reaction. Chemicals or medications associated with development of lichen planus include gold, antibiotics, arsenic, iodides, chloroquine, quinacrine, quinidine, antimony, phenothiazines, diuretics such as chlorothiazide, and many others.[2483] Consideration regarding role of drugs that were started in recent months prior to the on set of oral lichen planus, as well as any contact allergens identified by patch testing is recommended. Symptoms may improve with the following measures: Meticulous oral hygiene Stopping smoking Topical steroids as drops, pastes, gels or sprays (e.g., triamcinolone paste) Steroid injections (intralesional triamcinolone) Mouth rinse containing the calcineurin inhibitors: cyclosporin or tacrolimus In severe cases systemic corticosteroids may be used.

            "answer": "Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder.  It is characterized by involuntary and rhythmic shaking (tremor), especially in the hands, without any other signs or symptoms. It is distinguished from tremor that results from other disorders or known causes, such as tremors seen with Parkinson disease or head trauma. Most cases of essential tremor are hereditary. There are five forms of essential tremor that are based on different genetic causes. Several genes as well as lifestyle and environmental factors likely play a role in a person's risk of developing this complex condition. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In cases where symptoms interfere with daily living, medications may help to relieve symptoms."

In these cases, essential tremor appears to be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern varies. In many affected families, the condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In other families, the inheritance pattern is unclear. Essential tremor may also appear in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In some families, there are individuals who have essential tremor while others have other movement disorders, such as involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia).

Although there is no definitive cure for essential tremor, medicines may help relieve symptoms. How well medicines work depend on the individual patient. Two medications used to treat tremors include: Propranolol, a drug that blocks the action of stimulating substances called neurotransmitters, particularly those related to adrenaline Primidone, an antiseizure drug that also control the function of some neurotransmitters These drugs can have significant side effects. Eliminating tremor \"triggers\" such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended. Physical therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients.

            "answer": "Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to recycle the vitamin biotin. The disorder may become apparent in the first few months of life, or later in childhood. The more severe form of the disorder is called 'profound biotinidase deficiency' and may cause delayed development, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, hearing and vision loss, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), skin rashes, hair loss (alopecia), and a fungal infection called candidiasis. The milder form is called 'partial biotinidase deficiency'; without treatment, affected children may experience hypotonia, skin rashes, and hair loss. In some cases, these symptoms only appear during illness, infection, or other times of stress on the body. Biotinidase deficiency is caused by mutations in the BTD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Chorea-acanthocytosis? Chorea-acanthocytosis affects movement in many parts of the body. Chorea refers to the involuntary jerking movements made by people with this disorder. People with this condition also have abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis). Another common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis is involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia), such as those in the limbs, face, mouth, tongue, and throat. These muscle twitches can cause vocal tics (such as grunting), involuntary belching, and limb spasms. Eating can also be impaired as tongue and throat twitches can interfere with chewing and swallowing food. People with chorea-acanthocytosis may uncontrollably bite their tongue, lips, and inside of the mouth. Nearly half of all people with chorea-acanthocytosis have seizures. Individuals with chorea-acanthocytosis may develop difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). They may also have reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) and muscle weakness (myopathy). Impaired muscle and nerve functioning commonly cause speech difficulties, and can lead to an inability to speak. Behavioral changes are also a common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis and may be the first sign of this condition. These behavioral changes may include changes in personality, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), lack of self-restraint, and the inability to take care of oneself. The signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis usually begin in early to mid-adulthood. The movement problems of this condition worsen with age.

            "answer": "How do people inherit chorea-acanthocytosis? Chorea-acanthocytosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

            "answer": "Acquired hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's blood clotting process. Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it generally occurs in older people (the median age of diagnosis is between 60 and 67 years). Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), hematuria, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot. About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune disease, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling bleeding episodes and addressing the underlying cause of the condition."

            "question": "What causes Myhre syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Myhre syndrome? Myhre syndrome is caused by mutations in the SMAD4 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. This signaling pathway, called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) pathway, allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. As part of this pathway, the SMAD4 protein interacts with other proteins to control the activity of particular genes. These genes influence many areas of development. Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer. Changes in SMAD4 binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types, which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Myhre syndrome."

            "answer": "Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a term that includes two conditions: immunotactoid glomerulopathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis, which are uncommon causes of glomerular disease. Most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities and some experts group these disorders together. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the 'fibrils' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and  randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have microtubule formations.  Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy.  Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas. All patients should be screened for these conditions. It is also important to rule out another disease known as amyloidosis. When the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as \"Congo red\" the results are negative. In amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids. Treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems."

            "answer": "Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome associated with deletions in a specific region of chromosome 11 (11p11.2). The characteristic features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include openings in the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina), multiple benign bone tumors called exostoses, intellectual disability, developmental delay, a distinctive facial appearance, autism and problems with vision and hearing. In some cases, individuals with the syndrome may have a defect in the heart, kidneys, or urinary tract. The features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome result from the loss of several genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. In particular, the deletion of a gene called ALX4 causes enlarged parietal foramina, while the loss of another gene, EXT2, causes the multiple exostoses. Another condition called WAGR syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material in the p arm of chromosome 11, specifically at position 11p13. Occasionally, a deletion is large enough to include the 11p11.2 and 11p13 regions. Individuals with such a deletion have signs and symptoms of both Potocki-Shaffer syndrome and WAGR syndrome. A referral to an early childhood intervention and developmental-behavioral specialist at the time of diagnosis and to have an evaluation for vision and hearing problems, as well as a full skeletal survey at the time of diagnosis or by age 3 years, whichever is later, is recommended."

            "answer": "Hypophosphatemic rickets (previously called vitamin D-resistant rickets) is a disorder in which the bones become painfully soft and bend easily, due to low levels of phosphate in the blood. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood and can range in severity. Severe forms may cause bowing of the legs and other bone deformities; bone pain; joint pain; poor bone growth; and short stature. In some affected babies, the space between the skull bones closes too soon (craniosynostosis). This sometimes results in developmental abnormalities. Hypophosphatemic rickets is almost always inherited and may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of several genes. Most commonly it is due to the PHEX gene and inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Less commonly it is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner (often called Dent disease); autosomal dominant manner; or autosomal recessive manner.

The specific gene involved determines the way it is inherited. Most commonly, it is caused by a mutation in the PHEX gene. Other genes that can be responsible for the condition include the CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3 genes. The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in keeping a proper balance of phosphate in the body. Many of these genes directly or indirectly regulate a protein that normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the blood. Mutations affecting the function of these genes increase the production (or reduce the breakdown) of the protein, causing the protein to be overactive. The overactivity of the protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to the features of the condition. Rarer, sporadic, acquired cases are sometimes associated with benign (non-cancerous) mesenchymal tumors that decrease resorption of phosphate."

            "question": "Is Hypophosphatemic rickets inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is hypophosphatemic rickets inherited? Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition. Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene (as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females. If a father has the mutated X-linked gene: all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome) none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome) If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene. Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner."

            "question": "What is (are) Parkinson disease ?",
            "answer": "Parkinson disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. The four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance. These symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time.  As they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.  Not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has Parkinson disease, as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. Parkinson disease affects about 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 60 years and the chance of developing Parkinson disease increases as we age. Although some Parkinson disease cases appear to be hereditary most cases are sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. When three or more people are affected in a family, especially if they are diagnosed at an early age (under 50 years)  there may be a gene making this family more likely to develop the condition. Currently, seven genes that cause some form of Parkinson's disease have been identified. Mutations (changes) in three known genes called SNCA (PARK1),UCHL1 (PARK 5), and LRRK2 (PARK8) and another mapped gene (PARK3) have been reported in families with dominant inheritance. Mutations in three known genes, PARK2 (PARK2), PARK7 (PARK7), and PINK1 (PARK6) have been found in affected individuals who had siblings with the condition but whose parents did not have Parkinson's disease (recessive inheritance). There is some research to suggest that these genes are also involved in early-onset Parkinson's disease (diagnosed before the age of 30) or in dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease but it is too early yet to be certain. However, in most cases inheriting a mutation will not cause someone to develop Parkinson's disease because there may be additional genes and environmental factors determining who will get the condition, when they get it and how it affects them."

Postencephalitic parkinsonism Drug-induced parkinsonism Toxin-induced parkinsonism Arteriosclerotic parkinsonism Parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam Post-traumatic parkinsonism  Essential tremor Normal pressure hydrocephalus  Progressive supranuclear palsy Corticobasal degeneration  Multiple system atrophy  Dementia with Lewy bodies  More information on each of these conditions is available in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) publication, Parkinson's Disease: Hope Through Research.  Parkinsonian symptoms may also appear in patients with other, clearly distinct neurological disorders such as Wilson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Each of these disorders has specific features that help to distinguish them from Parkinson disease. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Parkinson disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What causes Parkinson disease ?",
            "answer": "What causes Parkinson disease? Parkinson disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine, a chemical messenger which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, are slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in the part of the brain known as the substantia nigra cannot properly send messages. This leads to progressive loss of muscle function. Exactly why these brain cells waste away is unknown. Recent studies have shown that people with Parkinson disease also experience damage to the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls the automatic functions of the body, including pulse and blood pressure. The loss of norepinephrine may explain some of the non-motor features seen in Parkinson disease, including fatigue and problems with blood pressure regulation.  More detailed information about the cause of Parkinson disease is available through an information page developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

            "question": "Is Parkinson disease inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is Parkinson disease inherited? Most cases of Parkinson disease are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. Although the cause of these cases remains unclear, sporadic cases probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Additionally, certain drugs may cause Parkinson-like symptoms. Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of the disorder. These familial cases are caused by mutations in the LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA gene, or by alterations in genes that have not yet been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic. It is not fully understood how mutations in the LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA gene cause Parkinson disease. Some mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As a result, un-degraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of dopamine-producing neurons. Other mutations may involve mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules, called free radicals, that can damage the cell. Normally, the cell neutralizes free radicals, but some gene mutations may disrupt this neutralization process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons. In some families, alterations in the GBA, SNCAIP, or UCHL1 gene appear to modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease. Researchers have identified some genetic changes that may reduce the risk of developing the disease, while other gene alterations seem to increase the risk."

            "answer": "How is Parkinson disease diagnosed? There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help diagnose sporadic cases of Parkinson disease. The diagnosis is generally made after careful evaluation of medical history, current symptoms, and exclusion of other conditions. The clinical findings of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia are highly suggestive of Parkinson disease. The genetic cause of some forms of Parkinson disease has been identified. In those cases, genetic testing may be utilized to identify affected family members."

            "answer": "Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) involves the immune system, the body's system of protecting ourselves against infection. The body fights infection with antibodies. Antibodies are made up of small protein segments called light chains and heavy chains. People with LCDD make  too many light chains which get deposited in many different tissues and organs of the body. While LCDD can occur in any organ, the kidneys are always involved. Deposits of light chains can also occur in the liver, heart, small intestine, spleen, skin, nervous system and bone marrow. Additionally, about 50-60% of patients with LCDD have multiple myeloma and 17% have a disease called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Early signs and symptoms of light chain deposition disease may include protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function, and nephrotic syndrome. The goal of treatment in patients with LCDD is to stop/decrease the production of light chains and damage to organs. Treatment options can include: autologous stem cell transplantation; a drug called Bortezomib; a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs; and kidney transplant."

It is known that the abnormal development of blood cells associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) develops as the result of a series of somatic genetic changes - mutations that are not inherited that arise after conception - in cells that later become blood cells. These changes alter normal cell growth and differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of abnormal, immature cells in the bone marrow, thus leading to the signs and symptoms of MDS. Some recurring chromosome abnormalities and translocations have been identified and can affect treatment planning and prognosis. Many times the underlying cause of MDS is unknown (idiopathic MDS). Sometimes, MDS can develop after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer or autoimmune diseases (secondary MDS). There are also some possible risk factors for developing the condition. Having a risk factor does not mean that an individual will get MDS; not having risk factors doesnt mean that an individual will not get MDS. Possible risk factors for MDS may include past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy; exposure to some chemicals (pesticides and benzene); exposure to heavy metals (such as mercury or lead); cigarette smoking; viral infections; being over 60 years of age; and being male or white. The majority of individuals developing MDS have no obvious connection with environmental hazards. MDS also sometimes runs in families, which suggests a potential genetic link with the disease; however, no disease causing gene has been identified."

            "question": "What causes Mosaic trisomy 14 ?",
            "answer": "What causes mosaic trisomy 14? Individuals with mosaic trisomy 14 have a duplication of chromosome 14 material in some of their cells, while other cells have a normal chromosomal makeup. The additional chromosomal material is responsible for the features that are characteristic of the condition. Most cases of mosaic trisomy 14 appear to result from random errors in the separation of chromosomes (nondisjunction) -- either during the division of the egg or sperm in one of the parents, or during cell division after fertilization. There have been some reports in which it may have occurred due to other phenomenon, such as uniparental disomy or the formation of an isochromosome. Uniparental disomy is when an affected individual inherits both copies of a chromosomal pair from one parent, rather than one copy from each parent. An isochromosome is an abnormal chromosome with identical arms on each side of the centromere. Unique has a leaflet on their Web site that contains additional descriptions and illustrations of how mosaic trisomy 14 may occur. Click here to view the leaflet."

People affected by Gardner syndrome have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer at an early age. They are also at an increased risk of developing other FAP-related cancers, such as those of the small bowel, stomach, pancreas, thyroid, central nervous system, liver, bile ducts, and/or adrenal gland. Other signs and symptoms of Gardner syndrome include dental abnormalities; osteomas (benign bone growths); various skin abnormalities such as epidermoid cysts, fibromas (a benign tumor of the connective tissue), and lipomas; and desmoid tumors. It is caused by changes (mutations) in the APC gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although there is no cure for Gardner syndrome, management options are available to reduce the risk of cancer. These may include high risk screening, prophylactic surgeries and/or certain types of medications."

            "question": "What causes Gardner syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Gardner syndrome? Gardner syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the APC gene, which is called a \"tumor suppressor.\" Tumor suppressor genes encode proteins that are part of the system that controls cell growth and division. These proteins ensure that cells do not grow and divide too quickly or in an abnormal manner. Mutations in the APC gene lead to uncontrolled cell growth which results in the development of the polyps, tumors and cancers that can be associated with Gardner syndrome. The symptoms found in each person and the severity of the condition depend on which part of the APC gene is mutated."

            "question": "Is Gardner syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Gardner syndrome inherited? Gardner syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with Gardner syndrome has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for Gardner syndrome? Yes, genetic testing is available for APC, the gene known to cause Gardner syndrome. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. Because colon screening for those at risk for Gardner syndrome begins as early as age ten years, genetic testing is generally offered to children by this age. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is Gardner syndrome diagnosed? Gardner syndrome is diagnosed based on the following features: At least 100 colorectal polyps OR fewer than 100 polyps and a family member with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis or Gardner syndrome Osteomas (bony growths) Soft tissue tumors such as epidermoid cysts, fibromas, and desmoid tumors These symptoms are usually identified using a combination of physical examination, colonoscopy, and X-rays of the long bones and/or jaw bone. The presence of other signs and symptoms such as stomach or small intestinal polyps; congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (a flat, pigmented spot within the outer layer of the retina); and/or associated cancers, supports the diagnosis. A diagnosis of Gardner syndrome can be confirmed by the identification of a disease-causing change (mutation) in the APC gene."

            "answer": "How might Gardner syndrome be treated? Although there is no cure for Gardner syndrome, treatment and management options are available to reduce the risk of cancer. For example, affected people typically undergo regular screening for the various polyps and tumors associated with Gardner syndrome to permit early diagnosis and treatment. This screening regimen may include: Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy every one to two years, beginning at age ten to 12 years. Once polyps are detected, colonoscopy is recommended annually until colectomy (removal of colon). EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) beginning by age 25 and repeated every one to three years. Annual physical examination, including a thorough thyroid evaluation beginning in the late teenage years. Screening for desmoid tumors and hepatoblastoma (a specific type of liver cancer that is diagnosed in young children) may also be recommended in some people. A colectomy is usually recommended when more than 20 or 30 polyps and/or multiple advanced polyps are identified. Sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), is sometimes prescribed in people with Gardner syndrome who have had a colectomy to treat polyps in the remaining rectum. Treatment for desmoid tumors varies depending on the size and location of the tumor, but may include watchful waiting, surgery, NSAIDS, anti-estrogen medications, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Osteomas (bony growths) may be removed for cosmetic reasons. Treatment of epidermoid cysts in Gardner syndrome is similar to that used for ordinary cysts and involves excision.

            "question": "What causes Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?",
            "answer": "What causes isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency)? IBD deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD8 gene. The ACAD8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing valine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. If a mutation in the ACAD8 gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down valine properly. As a result, poor growth and reduced energy production may occur."

            "question": "Is Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency) inherited? IBD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?",
            "answer": "How is isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency) treated? There is no standard treatment protocol for IBD deficiency. Infants diagnosed through newborn screening are encouraged to work with a metabolic disease specialist and a dietician experienced in metabolic disorders. Some treatments may be recommended even if no symptoms have been observed. Treatment may be needed throughout life. The following treatments may be recommended for some babies and children with IBD deficiency.  Children with IBD deficiency may be helped by taking L-carnitine, a safe and natural substance which helps the body's cells make energy and get rid of harmful wastes. L-carnitine may also help to prevent or treat the heart problems and anemia seen in children with IBD deficiency. Children with IBD deficiency are advised to avoid fasting. Going without food for a long time causes the body to use its stores of fat and protein for energy. In some people with IBD deficiency, this may lead to the build up of harmful substances in the blood. Eating frequently (every 4 to 6 hours) may help to avoid these health effects. While most children with IBD deficiency do fine without a change in diet, a low-valine food plan might be necessary. Valine is found in all foods with protein. Foods high in valine, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans and legumes, nuts and peanut butter should be limited. There are medical foods such low-protein flours, pastas, rice, and special formulas that are made especially for people with organic acid disorders. Your dietician / physician can advise you on whether you should use these foods to supplement your childs diet."

            "answer": "Asthma is a breathing disorder that affects the airways. People with this condition experience recurrent swelling and narrowing of the airways of the lungs which is associated with wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Most affected people have episodes of symptoms (\"asthma attacks\") followed by symptom-free periods; however, some may experience persistent shortness of breath in between attacks. Asthma is considered a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely due to a combination of multiple genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever or eczema. Having a family member with asthma is associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. Treatment generally includes various medications, both to prevent asthma attacks and to provide quick relief during an attack."

Schindler disease type 1, also called the infantile type, is the most severe form. Babies with this condition appear healthy a birth, but by the age of 8 to 15 months they stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they had already acquired. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop blindness and seizures, and eventually lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. People with this form of the condition usually don't survive past early childhood. Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the NAGA gene.

            "answer": "What causes Schindler disease type 1? Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the NAGA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.This enzyme works in the lysosomes  (compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials) to help break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids (sugar molecules attached to certain proteins and fats). More specifically, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase helps remove a molecule called alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine from sugars in these complexes. Mutations in the NAGA gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down glycoproteins and glycoliipids. These substances accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Cell damage in the nervous system and other tissues and organs of the body leads to the signs and symptoms of Schindler disease type 1."

            "answer": "How might nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis be treated? Treatment for nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis (NNP) generally aims at controlling and relieving the symptoms that an individual has. Before treatment is initiated, a work-up should be completed to determine whether the condition is secondary to another underlying disorder. If there is an underlying disorder, treatment of this disorder may relieve the symptoms of NNP. In some cases, skin lesions heal spontaneously (remission) but the lesions often later return. There is no treatment method found to be effective for all individuals with NNP. Medications used to treat the condition may include systemic steroids (such as prednisone) to suppress sudden attacks; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce fever and other signs of malaise; and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Relief of symptoms in some affected individuals has also been reported with fibrinolytic agents (medications that help prevent blood clots), hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, tetracycline, cyclosporin, mycophenolate, and clofazimine.

DDEB is one of the milder forms of EB, although the severity is variable. Blisters may be present at birth, but typically appear during early childhood; occasionally they do not develop until later in life. Blisters often become more numerous and tend to occur over vulnerable sites such as knees, ankles, elbows and knuckles. In adulthood, they usually become less frequent and scars fade. Other signs and symptoms of DDEB may include dystrophic or absent nails, constipation, dental caries and swallowing problems. It is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment typically includes treating blisters and avoiding infection."

            "answer": "What causes dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa? Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene. The COL7A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is used to assemble type VII collagen. Collagen gives structure and strength to connective tissues, such as skin, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. Type VII collagen plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is the main component of structures called anchoring fibrils, which anchor the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, to an underlying layer called the dermis. COL7A1 mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of type VII collagen, which impairs its ability to help connect the epidermis to the dermis. When type VII collagen is abnormal or missing, friction or other minor trauma can cause the two skin layers to separate. This separation leads to the formation of blisters, which can cause extensive scarring as they heal. A diagram of the skin structure including the area of skin implicated in DDEB is provided by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Click on the link for more."

            "answer": "How is dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inherited? Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the gene with the mutation in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. About 70 percent of individuals with DDEB have inherited a COL7A1 mutation from an affected parent. The remaining 30 percent have the condition as a result of a new (de novo) mutation in the COL7A1 gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Regardless of whether an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has inherited the mutation or has a new mutation, each child of the affected individual has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of also having the condition, and a 50% chance of not having the condition."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ?",
            "answer": "How might dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa be treated? There is currently no cure for all types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Treatment generally focuses on managing signs and symptoms. For some individuals, such as those that have a mild form of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), dystrophic nails may be the only manifestation. However, other individuals may have much more severe problems that need to be managed. Management typically focuses on treating blisters and avoiding or treating infections. Wound care usually included treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Additionally in most cases, wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Due to the increased risk of bacterial resistance, topical antibiotic ointments and antimicrobial dressings should be reserved for those wounds that are colonized with bacteria and fail to heal, referred to as critical colonization.\" Individuals with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) have increased caloric and protein needs due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing. Involvement of the digestive system in some forms of EB may limit nutritional intake. Infants and children with more severe forms of EB and failure to thrive usually require attention to fluid and electrolyte balance and may require nutritional support, including a gastrotomy feeding tube. Anemia is typically treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. Other nutritional supplements may include calcium, vitamin D, selenium, carnitine, and zinc. Surveillance is important for individuals with DEB. Biopsies of abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal may be recommended in some types of DEB due to predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma, beginning in the second decade of life. Screening for deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine is typically recommended after the first year of life. Routine echocardiograms are recommended to identify dilated cardiomyopathy, and bone mineral density studies are recommended to identify osteoporosis. Activities and bandages that may traumatize the skin (including all adhesives) should typically be avoided. Recent treatment advancements and therapies under investigation include but are not limited to:  Use of biological dressings to treat chronic or recurrent skin ulcers Bone marrow transplantation Intra-dermal (in the skin) injection of fibroblasts Protein replacement therapy (intra-dermal injection of type VII collagen)  Gene therapy Revertant mosaicism Gene correction technologies (ex.

The seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 do not generally respond well to medications. The treatment that is successful varies from person to person. Broad spectrum AEDs are usually tried first since they are active against different seizure types. This includes valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate and zonisamide. Success has been reported in some people with a combination of valproate and lamotrigine, but so far no single therapy has worked for everyone.  Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been tried and a reduction in seizures has been reported in some cases but not in others. This involves implanting a medical device under the skin, similar to a pacemaker that delivers a mild electrical current to the brain via the vagus nerve. The long-term effectiveness of VNS therapy is not yet known.  The ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrate, has been shown to be helpful in other types of epilepsy. However there are no published reports about whether this is successful or not in ring chromosome 20 epilepsy.

            "answer": "Camurati-Engelmann disease is a genetic condition that mainly affects the bones. People with this disease have increased bone density, particularly affecting the long bones of the arms and legs. In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. The age at which affected individuals first experience symptoms varies greatly; however, most people with this condition develop pain or weakness by adolescence. Camurati-Engelmann disease is caused by a mutation in the TGFB1 gene which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In some instances, people have the gene mutation that causes Camurati-Engelmann disease but never develop the characteristic features of this condition. In others, features are present, but a mutation cannot be identified. These cases are referred to as Camurati-Engelmann disease type II.  Treatment for Camurati-Engelman disease depends on many factors including the signs and symptoms present in each person and the severity of the condition."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Camurati-Engelmann disease? People with Camurati-Engelmann disease have increased bone density, particularly affecting the long bones of the arms and legs (tibia, femur, humerus, ulna, radius). In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. An increase in the density of the skull results in increased pressure on the brain and can cause a variety of neurological problems, including headaches, hearing loss, vision problems, dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and facial paralysis. The added pressure that thickened bones put on the muscular and skeletal systems can cause abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), joint deformities (contractures), knock knees, and flat feet (pes planus). Other features of Camurati-Engelmann disease include abnormally long limbs in proportion to height, a decrease in muscle mass and body fat, and delayed puberty. In the most severe cases, the mandibula (jaw), vertebrae, thoracic cage, shoulder girdle, and carpal (hands, wrist) and tarsal (foot, ankle) bones are involved. Radiographically (on X-ray), the shafts of long bones show symmetric and progressive widening and malformation (diaphyseal dysplasia). Vascular (Raynaud's phenomenon) and hematological (anemia, leukopenia (low level of white blood cells), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate) features and hepatosplenomegaly are commonly associated with the disease. The age at which affected individuals first experience symptoms varies greatly; however, most people with this condition develop pain or weakness by adolescence.

            "question": "What causes Camurati-Engelmann disease ?",
            "answer": "What causes Camurati-Engelmann disease? Mutations in the TGFB1 gene cause Camurati-Engelmann disease. The TGFB1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1). The TGF-1 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The TGF-1 protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth, the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. TGF-1 is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). Within cells, the TGF-1 protein is turned off (inactive) until it receives a chemical signal to become active. The TGFB1 gene mutations that cause Camurati-Engelmann disease result in the production of a TGF-1 protein that is always turned on (active). Overactive TGF-1 proteins lead to increased bone density and decreased body fat and muscle tissue, contributing to the signs and symptoms of Camurati-Engelmann disease. Some individuals with Camurati-Engelmnan disease do not have identified mutations in the TGFB1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

            "question": "Is Camurati-Engelmann disease inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Camurati-Engelmann disease inherited? Camurati-Engelmann disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a de novo mutation. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation."

            "answer": "How might Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) be treated? Several medical therapies including corticosteroids, biphosphonates, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used to manage the symptoms of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). NSAIDs and bisphosphonates have not been proven to be effective for most people with CED. Corticosteroids may relieve some of the symptoms such as pain and weakness and can also improve gait and exercise tolerance, however corticosteroids have serious side effects with long term use. More recently, losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to reduce limb pain and increase muscle strength in multiple case reports. However, the effectiveness of losartan needs more study to determine if it is effective for those with CED and without major side effects. Exercise programs when they are tolerated have also been found to be beneficial. Please note, case reports report the clinical findings associated with individual cases. It is important to keep in mind that the clinical findings documented in these case reports are based on specific individuals and may differ from one affected person to another."

People with this condition cannot break down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). CSID usually becomes apparent after an infant begins to consume fruits, juices, and grains. After ingestion of sucrose or maltose, an affected child will typically experience stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and diarrhea. These digestive problems can lead to failure to thrive and malnutrition. Most affected children are better able to tolerate sucrose and maltose as they get older.

Affected infants usually develop symptoms soon after they first ingest sucrose, which is found in modified milk formulas, fruits, or starches. Symptoms may include explosive, watery diarrhea resulting in abnormally low levels of body fluids (dehydration), abdominal swelling (distension), and/or abdominal discomfort. In addition, some affected infants may experience malnutrition, resulting from malabsorption of essential nutrients, and/or failure to thrive, resulting from nutritional deficiencies. In some cases, individuals may exhibit irritability; colic; abrasion and/or irritation (excoriation) of the skin on the buttocks as a result of prolonged diarrhea episodes; and/or vomiting. Symptoms of this disorder vary among affected individuals, but are usually more severe in infants and young children than in adults. Symptoms exhibited in infants and young children are usually more pronounced than those of the affected adults because the diet of younger individuals often includes a higher carbohydrate intake.

Signs and symptoms vary but may include progressive weakness, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, backache, a 'weak' bladder, and constipation. The HTLV-1 virus can be transmitted from mother to child via breastfeeding or childbirth, from person to person through sexual contact and through blood contact, either by transfusion or by reuse of injection equipment. HTLV infection is not passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, kissing, cuddling or daily social contact. Screening of donated blood for HTLV-1 has been done in the United States since 1988."

There is no established treatment program for HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).  Corticosteroids may relieve some symptoms, but arent likely to change the course of the disorder.  Clinical studies suggest that interferon alpha provides benefits over short periods and some aspects of disease activity may be improved favorably using interferon beta. Stiff and spastic muscles may be treated with lioresal or tizanidine.  Urinary dysfunction may be treated with oxybutynin."

            "question": "What is (are) Urea cycle disorders ?",
            "answer": "A urea cycle disorder is a genetic disorder that results in a deficiency of one of the six enzymes in the urea cycle. These enzymes are responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which nitrogen, a waste product of protein metabolism, is changed to a compound called urea and removed from the blood. Normally, the urea is removed from the body through the urine. In urea cycle disorders, nitrogen builds up in the blood in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance, resulting in hyperammonemia (elevated blood ammonia). Ammonia then reaches the brain through the blood, where it can cause irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. The onset and severity of urea cycle disorders is highly variable. The severity correlates with the amount of urea cycle enzyme function."

            "answer": "Factor XI deficiency is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's clotting process. As a result, people affected by this condition may have difficulty stopping the flow of blood following dental extractions, trauma or surgery. Women with factor XI deficiency may also experience heavy menstrual periods or heavy postpartum bleeding. Within affected people and their families, highly variable bleeding patterns occur, and bleeding risk can not be predicted by the level of factor XI (a clotting factor) in the blood. Although the condition can affect people of all heritages, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Most cases of factor XI deficiency are inherited and caused by changes (mutations) in the F11 gene. The condition is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, it may follow an autosomal dominant pattern in some families. Treatment is often only recommended during periods of high bleeding risk (i.e. surgery) and may include fresh frozen plasma and/or antifibrinolytics (medications that improve blood clotting). Factor XI concentrates may be available for factor replacement in some countries."

It is a type of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Affected individuals have slow, hesitant speech due to difficulty retrieving the correct words, names, or numbers. Difficulty with phase and sentence repetition are additionally present. Speech is typically well articulated and grammatically correct with good single-word comprehension. But over time, affected individuals may have trouble understanding long or complex verbal information, due to problems holding onto lengthy information that they hear. Language difficulties associated with LPA are due to shrinking, or atrophy, in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Click here to view an image of the lobes of the brain."

Although no medications or interventions have demonstrated long-term stabilization of logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), different treatment methods have shown promising short-term benefits. Studies utilizing language therapy and behavioral interventions have shown encouraging results. Neuromodulation through methodologies such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have additionally been identified as a promising therapies to potentially use in combination with behavioral treatment and language therapy. As the most common underlying pathology of LPA is Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, limited research has been completed on interventions shown to reduce the rate of decline in cognitive symptoms in AD. So far cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, medications used in Alzheimers disease, have not been proven effective in treating logopenic progressive aphasia. Case studies involving steriod use and Omentum Transposition Therapy have reported improvement; however, the results have not been replicated in other cases and as with other treatment options, long-term studies are lacking.

Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS) is typically characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, short stature, sparse hair, distinctive facial features, short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), and prominent joints of the fingers and toes (called interphalangeal joints). Some features of the condition may vary among affected people. All people with NCBRS have intellectual disability. In most cases it is severe, but in some cases it may be moderate or mild. Language is particularly limited, with at least 30% of affected people never developing speech. Major motor milestones such as sitting and walking are usually not very delayed. People with NCBRS are often happy and friendly, but may have temper tantrums or periods of aggression. Some people have some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy occurs in about 2/3 of affected people. The type of seizures that occur can vary. Facial characteristics are usually not recognized in younger affected people. They may include a triangular-shaped face; prominent eyelashes; a nose with a broad base, thick nostrils, and upturned tip; a broad philtrum; and wide mouth. The palpebral fissures (width of the eyes) are sometimes narrow and/or downslanting. As people with NCBRS age, the amount of subcutaneous fat tissue tends to decrease, making the skin below the eyes sagging and wrinkled, especially at the cheeks when smiling. However, some affected people retain full cheeks. Facial characteristics typically become more pronounced with increasing age. In some affected adults, the lower third of the face becomes markedly broad. Sparse scalp hair is a major feature of NCBRS and is present in almost all affected people. It often gradually worsens with age, but in some people it improves over time. Skin is usually wrinkled and more noticeable in the distal limbs. Teeth may be widely spaced, and eruption of teeth (baby or adult) may be delayed.

The condition affects the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This affects the sharpness of vision. Central vision is more commonly affected. Vision often deteriorates early in life, but then usually becomes stable until late adulthood. A second decline in vision typically occurs in a man's fifties or sixties. Sometimes severe complications occur, including separation of the retinal layers (retinal detachment) or leakage of blood vessels in the retina (vitreous hemorrhage). These can lead to blindness. Juvenile retinoschisis is caused by mutations in the RS1 gene. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Low-vision aids can be helpful. Surgery may be needed for some complications."

Studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina, perhaps playing a role in cell adhesion (the attachment of cells together). RS1 gene mutations lead to a reduced amount or complete absence of retinoschisin, which can cause tiny splits (schisis) or tears to form in the retina. This damage often forms a \"spoke-wheel\" pattern in the macula, which can be seen during an eye examination. In about half of individuals, these abnormalities are seen in the area of the macula, affecting visual acuity. In the other half, the sides of the retina are affected, resulting in impaired peripheral vision. Some individuals with juvenile retinoschisis do not have a mutation in the RS1 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown."

            "question": "Is Juvenile retinoschisis inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is juvenile retinoschisis inherited? Juvenile retinoschisis is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene (mutation) in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the mutation, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the condition. Carrier women have a 50% chance of passing the mutation to their children, males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and will nearly always have normal vision. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known."

            "answer": "What treatment is available for juvenile retinoschisis? There is no specific treatment for juvenile retinoschisis. Low vision services are designed to benefit those whose ability to function is compromised by impaired vision. Public school systems are mandated by federal law to provide appropriate education for children who have vision impairment. Surgery may be required to address the infrequent complications of vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Affected individuals should avoid high-contact sports and other activities that can cause head trauma to reduce risk of retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage."

            "answer": "Pili torti is a rare hair condition characterized by fragile hair. In pili torti hair has a flattened shaft with clusters of narrow twists at irregular intervals. Some cases may be inherited in autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive patterns, while others are acquired. In the inherited form, symptoms tend to be present from early childhood. It can occur alone or as part of other diseases like ectodermal dysplasias, Menke disease, Bjornstand syndrome, or Bazex syndrome. Acquired cases of pili torti may be associated with anorexia nervosa, malnutrition, oral retinoid treatment, or inflammatory scalp conditions (e.g., cutaneous lupus erythematousus). If pili torti is detected, it is necessary to investigate possible neurological disorders, hearing loss, and defects in the hair, nails, sweat glands and teeth. There is no specific treatment for this condition, but it may improve spontaneously after puberty. Click here to visit Medscape and view an image of a child with pili torti."

            "answer": "The congenital muscle dystrophies are currently classified according to the genetic defects. Historically, congenital muscular dystrophies were classified in two broad groups: Classic CMD (which included the Merosin-deficient CMD and the Merosin-positive CMD) and the CMD with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome). Therefore, merosin-positive congenital muscle dystrophy (CMD) is now considered an old term which refers to a group of diseases without structural brain abnormalities that are caused by a variety of gene mutations, resulting in protein defects that do not affect the merosin protein. It usually has a milder phenotype than the merosin-negative CMD dystrophy group and includes, among others: Classic CMD without distinguishing features Rigid spine syndrome associated with mutations in the selenoprotein N1 gene (SEPN1) CMD with hyperextensible distal joints (Ullrich type) CMD with intellectual disability or sensory abnormalities. The pattern of muscle weakness and wasting in the patients within this group of congenital muscular dystrophy conditions is worse in the proximal upper limb-girdle and trunk muscles. Lower limb muscles may be mildly involved. Muscle biopsy shows a dystrophic pattern with normal staining for dystrophin, laminin alpha-2 of merosin and the sarcoglycans."

            "answer": "Mikulicz disease is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal enlargement of glands in the head and neck, including those near the ears (parotids), around the eyes (lacrimal), and around the mouth (salivary). The tonsils and other glands in the soft tissue of the face and neck can also be affected. Although this condition is usually benign, it always occurs in association with another underlying disorder such as tuberculosis, leukemia, syphilis, Hodgkin's disease, Sjogren syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus. People with Mikulicz disease are at greater risk of developing lymphomas. Some people may experience recurring fevers accompanied by dry eyes, diminished tear production, and inflammation of various parts of the eyes (uveitis). The exact cause of Mikulicz syndrome is unknown. But some researchers believe that it should be considered a form of Sjogren syndrome."

            "question": "What is (are) Periventricular heterotopia ?",
            "answer": "Periventricular heterotopia is a condition in which the nerve cells (neurons) do not migrate properly during the early development of the fetal brain from about the 6th week to the 24th week of pregnancy. Affected people typically develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in mid-adolescence. Intelligence is generally normal; however, some affected people may have mild intellectual disability, including difficulty with reading and/or spelling. Less common signs and symptoms include microcephaly, developmental delay, recurrent infections, and blood vessel abnormalities. Some cases are caused by changes (mutations) in the FLNA gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Others are caused by mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely, periventricular heterotopia is associated with duplication of genetic material on chromosome 5. Treatment is generally focused on managing recurrent seizures with medications."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Periventricular heterotopia ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of periventricular nodular heterotopia? The condition is first noticed when seizures appear, often during the teenage years. The nodules around the ventricles are then typically discovered when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are done. Patients usually have normal intelligence, although some have mild intellectual disability. Difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia) has been reported in some girls with periventricular heterotopia. Less commonly, individuals with periventricular heterotopia may have more severe brain malformations, small head size (microcephaly), developmental delays, recurrent infections, blood vessel abnormalities, or other problems. In the X-linked form of periventricular nodular heterotopia, affected patients are mostly females because in males the symptoms are too serious and they die before birth. The following clinical features have been reported: seizure disorder, mental problems, heart anomalies, stomach immobility, strabismus, short fingers and dyslexia. Periventricular heterotopia may also occur in association with other conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos with periventricular heterotopia) which results in extremely flexible joints, skin that stretches easily, and fragile blood vessels. In the autosomal recessive form of periventricular heterotopia the disorder is severe and may include microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and seizures beginning in infancy. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show any signs or symptoms of this condition."

            "answer": "How might periventricular nodular heterotopia be treated? Treatment of epilepsy generally follows principles for a seizure disorder caused by a known structural brain abnormality; carbamezipine is most often used, because most patients have focal seizures. However, antiepileptic drugs may be selected based on side effects, tolerability, and efficacy. It is recommended that patients with the X-linked form of the disease have studies evaluating the carotid artery and an abdominal ultrasound because of the risk for aortic or carotid dissection or other vascular anomalies.[1823] Treatment also include surgery for removal of the lesion and more recently, laser ablation guided with magnetic resonance."

It is a very rare disease and very few patients have been reported to date. In them, age of onset ranged from the early teens to the second decade of life and life span was normal. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms and with a genetic exam showing an alteration (mutation) in the TTBK2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include speech and language therapy for talking and swallowing problems, occupational therapy, including home adaptations, physiotherapy and use of assistive walking devices and ankle-foot orthotics (AFOs) for those with neuropathy."

            "answer": "How is spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 inherited? SCA11 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The rate of de novo mutations is not known. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for at-risk pregnancies is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in a parent. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptom. The affected family member should be tested first to confirm the molecular diagnosis in the family.

Depending on the type of infection, one or more joints may be affected. Certain bacteria can cause a form of infectious arthritis called reactive arthritis, which appears to be caused by the immune system reacting to bacteria, rather than by the infection itself. In reactive arthritis, joint inflammation develops weeks, months or even years after the infection. Reactive arthritis happens most commonly after infections of the genital and gastrointestinal tracts.

            "answer": "How might giant congenital nevus be treated? Treatment for giant congenital nevus depends on the age of the affected individual as well as the size, location, and thickness of the nevus. Surgery may be done to remove the nevus, particularly when there is a concern that it may develop into a melanoma. When small nevi are removed, the surrounding skin can often be pulled together with stitches. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages and full-thickness skin grafts may be needed to help the skin heal following surgery. Laser treatments may be used for superficial skin imperfections, including reducing pigment and hair, but cannot completely remove the nevus. Affected individuals should self-monitor and continue to have regular skin examinations to check for benign or malignant tumors. Early awareness will allow their physicians  to adjust treatment protocols  accordingly. Children are most likely to show neurological signs before primary school and can respond well to a range of symptomatic therapies."

            "question": "Is Corneal endothelial dystrophy type 2 inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is corneal endothelial dystropy type 2 inherited? Most cases of corneal endothelial dystrophy type 2 are caused by homozygous mutations in the SLC4A11 gene. The condition is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that two unaffected parents each carry one copy of a gene mutation for the condition. Neither parent will show signs or symptoms of the condition because two copies are needed for the condition to occur. There have been several families with corneal endothelial dystrophy type 2 where no mutation was found in the SLC4A11 gene.

            "answer": "Cone dystrophy is a general term for a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone cells allow a person to see color and fine detail, and they work best in bright light. The cone dystrophies can cause a variety of symptoms such as decreased visual clarity when looking straight ahead, a reduced ability to see colors, and an increased sensitivity to light. There are two main subtypes of cone dystrophy, called stationary cone dystrophy and progressive cone dystrophy. The age when symptoms begin, the type and severity of symptoms, and the progression of symptoms are all very different between individuals, even between people with the same type of cone dystrophy. Mutations in many genes have been found to cause cone dystrophy, and the condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner."

            "answer": "How is cone dystrophy diagnosed? The diagnosis of cone dystrophy is made based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms, a detailed family history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a number of supporting tests. While exams that measure visual acuity, perception of color, and field of vision are used to arrive at a proper diagnosis, an electroretinogram (ERG) is used to confirm the diagnosis. During an ERG, eye drops are used to numb the eye before a special contact lens recorder is placed on the eye. Then a series of flashes of light are used to stimulate the retina. Doctors can then measure the electrical response of the rods and cones to the light. The test is performed twice  once in  bright room and again in a dark room. A weak of absent signal of cone cells indicates cone dystrophy. More details about the diagnosis of cone dystrophy can be accessed through the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center."

The donor twin may be born smaller, with paleness, anemia, and dehydration. The recipient twin may be born larger, with redness, too much blood, and increased blood pressure, resulting in an increased risk for heart failure. Treatment may require repeated amniocentesis during pregnancy. Fetal laser surgery may be done to interrupt the flow of blood from one twin to the other. After birth, treatment depends on the infant's specific symptoms. The donor twin may need a blood transfusion to treat anemia. The recipient twin may need to have the volume of body fluid reduced. This may involve an exchange transfusion. Medications may be given to treat heart failure in the recipient twin."

Fibrofolliculomas are a type of benign skin tumor specific to BHDS. They typically occur on the face, neck, and upper torso. Most people with BHDS also have multiple cysts in both lungs that can be seen on high-resolution chest CT scan. While these cysts usually do not cause any symptoms, they put people at increased risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. BHDS is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene.

            "answer": "How might lung cysts associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome be treated? At the time of diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, a computed tomography (CT) scan, or high resolution CT scan if available, should be done to determine the number, location, and size of any cysts in the lungs.  There is no recommended management of the lung cysts.  Lung cysts related to BHD have not been associated with long-term disability or fatality.  The main concern is that the cysts may increase the chance of developing a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). If an individual with BHD experiences any symptoms of a collapsed lung - such as chest pain, discomfort, or shortness of breath - they should immediately go to a physician for a chest x-ray or CT scan.  Therapy of a collapsed lung depends on the symptoms, how long it has been present, and the extent of any underlying lung conditions.  It is thought that collapsed lung can be prevented by avoiding scuba diving, piloting airplanes, and cigarette smoking. Individuals with BHD who have a history of multiple instances of collapsed lung or signs of lung disease are encouraged to see a lung specialist (pulmonologist)."

Not all infants exposed to phenytoin will be affected with the disorder. Symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays. Other findings occasionally associated with this syndrome include cleft lip and palate, having an abnormally small head (microcephaly) and brain malformations with more significant developmental delays. Treatment may include surgery for cleft lip and palate and special education and related services for children with learning delays. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Fetal hydantoin syndrome? There is a wide range in the nature and severity of characteristics associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome. Of infants born to women who used phenytoin during pregnancy, 10-30% are reported to show some of the characteristics associated with this syndrome. Few infants exposed only to phenytoin have all of the characteristic that have been reported. Children with this condition may be small at birth, with increased hair on the body and face, and with poorly developed fingernails and toenails. They may also have poor muscle tone. Facial features that may be present with this syndrome include a flat bridge of the nose; an underdeveloped vertical groove in the center of the upper lip (philtrum); a large mouth; and malformed ears. Features specific to the eyes may include down-slanted eyes; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); crossed eyes (strabismus); drooping eyelids (ptosis); and/or epicanthal folds (skin folds of the eyelid covering the inner corner of the eye). Other features that have been reported include a short or webbed neck and low-set hair line. Growth deficiencies may include underdeveloped fingers and/or toes, malformed nails, as well as finger-like thumbs. These features are often associated with growth delay and varying degrees of developmental delay. The risk for an affected child to be neurologically impaired is estimated at 1 to 11 % (two to three times higher than for the general population). The risk of cleft lip and/or palate and heart defects is estimated to be about five times higher among exposed infants.

In addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because of these eyelid malformations, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited. BPES type 2 consists only of the eyelid malformations, whereas  BPES type 1 also causes premature ovarian failure. It is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment typically consists of various eyelid surgeries to correct the malformations."

            "answer": "C1q nephropathy is a kidney disease in which a large amount of protein is lost in the urine. It is one of the many diseases that can cause the nephrotic syndrome. C1q is a normal protein in the immune system, and can be found floating in the circulation of most healthy people. In C1q nephropathy, however, this protein can also be found deposited throughout the kidneys. It has been thought to be a subgroup of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or to be a combination of several disease groups rather than a single disease. As a disease, it is very similar to minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Criteria diagnosis includes C1q deposits on the kidney and no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Both children and adult patients may have no symptoms, except for the presence of blood or protein in the urine, or  present with swelling of the feet and legs, high blood pressure and kidney insufficiency. The treatment of C1q nephropathy is the same as for MCD or FSGS and includes corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. Further research is needed to establish C1q nephropathy as a recognized distinct clinical entity."

            "answer": "Tourette syndrome is a complex neurological disorder that is characterized by repetitive, sudden, uncontrolled (involuntary) movements and sounds (vocalizations) called tics. Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Tourette syndrome. A small number of people with Tourette syndrome have been found to have mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene. The syndrome is believed to be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain, and the chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another. It is estimated that about 1% of the population has Tourette syndrome. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. Although Tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood."

Although the cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions (including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex), the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) responsible for communication among nerve cells. Given the often complex presentation of Tourette syndrome, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex. In many cases, there is a family history of tics, Tourette Syndrome, ADHD, OCD. In 2005, scientists discovered the first gene mutation that may cause some cases of Tourette syndrome. This gene, named SLITRK1, is normally involved with the growth of nerve cells and how they connect with other neurons.  The mutated gene is located in regions of the brain (basal ganglia, cortex, and frontal lobes) previously identified as being associated with Tourette syndrome."

            "question": "Is Tourette syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is Tourette syndrome inherited? Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that Tourette syndrome is an inherited disorder. Although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder), more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex. Although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of Tourette syndrome. Genetic studies also suggest that some forms of ADHD and OCD are genetically related to Tourette syndrome, but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between Tourette syndrome and other neurobehavioral problems that commonly co-occur with Tourette syndrome. Due to the complex nature of Tourette syndrome inheritance, affected families and those at risk may benefit from consulting with a genetics professional.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Tourette syndrome ?",
            "answer": "How might Tourette syndrome be treated? Many individuals with Tourette syndrome have mild symptoms and do not require medication. However, effective medications are available for those whose symptoms interfere with functioning. Neuroleptics are the most consistently useful medications for tic suppression; a number are available but some are more effective than others (for example, haloperidol and pimozide). Unfortunately, there is no one medication that is helpful to all people with Tourette syndrome, nor does any medication completely eliminate symptoms. In addition, all medications have side effects. Additional medications with demonstrated efficacy include alpha-adrenergic agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine. These medications are used primarily for hypertension but are also used in the treatment of tics. Effective medications are also available to treat some of the associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with Tourette syndrome. Recent research shows that stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine can lessen ADHD symptoms in people with Tourette syndrome without causing tics to become more severe.  However, the product labeling for stimulants currently contraindicates the use of these drugs in children with tics/Tourette syndrome and those with a family history of tics.  For obsessive-compulsive symptoms that significantly disrupt daily functioning, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) have been proven effective in some individuals. Behavioral treatment such as awareness training and competing response training can also be used to reduce tics. Psychotherapy may be helpful as well. It can help with accompanying problems, such as ADHD, obsessions, depression and anxiety. Therapy can also help people cope with Tourette syndrome. For debilitating tics that don't respond to other treatment, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may help. DBS consists of implanting a battery-operated medical device (neurostimulator) in the brain to deliver electrical stimulation to targeted areas that control movement. Further research is needed to determine whether DBS is beneficial for people with Tourette syndrome."

However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Many researchers suspect that there may be more than one cause for the condition. The following abnormalities can be associated with POTS and may play a role in the development of the condition: Peripheral denervation - reduced nerve stimulation to certain muscles. The lower extremities are generally most affected in people with POTS. Hypovolemia - an abnormal decrease or redistribution of blood in the body Changes in venous function - more specifically, a reduction in the volume of blood that returns to the heart (venous return) when moving from a lying down to a standing position Cardiovascular deconditioning - changes in cardiovascular function Baroreflex abnormalities - the baroreflexes play an important role in blood pressure regulation. When they sense a change in blood pressure, the heart rate is adjusted and the sympathetic nerve system fibers are activated to cause the blood vessels to narrow. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Although most cases of POTS appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, some affected people report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some cases. Some studies also suggest that polymorphisms in certain genes (NOS3, ADRB2) may be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition and a change (mutation) in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) has been identified in one family with POTS."

            "question": "What is (are) Protein C deficiency ?",
            "answer": "Protein C deficiency is a disorder that increases a person's risk to develop abnormal blood clots. The condition can be mild or severe. People with mild protein C deficiency are at risk for a type of clot called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT can travel through the bloodstream and become stuck in the lung, which can cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, but certain factors can increase the risk to develop a blood clot. In severe protein C deficiency, affected infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. This is characterized by blood clots that block normal blood flow and can lead to death of body tissues (necrosis). Abnormal bleeding can occur in various parts of the body causing purple patches on the skin. Protein C deficiency may be inherited or acquired. The inherited form is caused by mutations in the PROC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most people with protein C deficiency do not have any symptoms and require no specific treatment. However, in situations of clot risk such as pregnancy, surgery or trauma, prevention treatment may be indicated. Patients with the severe form of the disease are treated depending on the symptoms. A protein C concentrate is effective in many cases. Liver transplant may cure the babies with this disease."

            "question": "What causes Protein C deficiency ?",
            "answer": "What causes protein C deficiency? Protein C deficiency can be inherited or acquired later in life. Inherited protein C deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene that provides instructions for making protein C, called the PROC gene. These mutations disrupt the protein's ability to control blood clotting. If protein C cannot control blood clotting, abnormal blood clots may form. Acquired protein C deficiency may be caused by large blood clots, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), infection (sepsis), and vitamin K deficiency. Treatment with warfarin or certain types of chemotherapy can also cause acquired protein C deficiency."

            "answer": "How is protein C deficiency inherited? Hereditary protein C deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one mutated copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause mild protein C deficiency. A mutated copy of the gene can be inherited from a person's mother or father. People who inherit two mutated copies of the gene have severe protein C deficiency."

            "question": "How to diagnose Protein C deficiency ?",
            "answer": "How is protein C deficiency diagnosed? A diagnosis of protein C deficiency might be suspected in someone with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism, especially if it occurs in a relatively young person (less than 50 years old) or has formed in an unusual location, such as the veins leading to the liver or kidney or the blood vessels of the brain. Laboratory tests are usually be done to look at the function or quantity of protein C in the blood. Functional tests are usually ordered, along with other tests for abnormal blood clotting, to screen for normal activity of protein C. Based on those results, concentrations of protein C may be measured to look for decreased production due to an acquired or inherited condition and to classify the type of deficiency. If the shortage of protein C is due to an inherited genetic change, the quantity of protein C available and the degree of activity can be used to help determine whether a person is heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation. Genetic testing is not necessary to make a diagnosis."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Protein C deficiency ?",
            "answer": "How might protein C deficiency be treated? Most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots and thus do not require treatment. However, people who have experienced a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism are usually treated with blood-thinning drugs such as heparin or warfarin, which help to prevent another blood clot from developing in the future. Preventative treatment with these blood-thinning drugs may also be considered in those with a family history of blood clotting, as well as in higher risk situations such as pregnancy. A protein C concentrate (Ceprotin) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for the treatment of protein C deficiency. High doses of intravenous protein C concentrates can help thin the blood and protect from blood clots. It can also be used a preventative treatment against blood clots during surgery, pregnancy delivery, prolonged immobility, or overwhelming infection in the blood stream (sepsis). Currently, no guidelines exist as to which patients should receive protein C concentrate. It is typically given only at times of increased risk for clotting, or when the blood thinner heparin by itself cannot be safely given because it would lead to an increased risk for bleeding. However, in those with severe protein C who have had severe bleeding complications on long-term blood thinning therapy, protein C concentrate has been used on a regular basis."

The symptoms of this form of proctitis may include bleeding from the rectum, the need to go to the bathroom frequently, tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, and rectal pain. People with ulcerative proctitis tend to have episodes when the symptoms worsen and periods without symptoms, although the course of the disease varies among affected individuals. Treatment involves applying 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) or steroid creams to the rectum. In some cases, an oral version of 5-ASA is used to prevent episodes."

            "question": "What is (are) X-linked sideroblastic anemia ?",
            "answer": "X-linked sideroblastic anemia is an inherited disorder that prevents developing red blood cells (erythroblasts) from making enough hemoglobin. People with X-linked sideroblastic anemia have mature red blood cells that are smaller than normal (microcytic) and appear pale (hypochromic) because of the shortage of hemoglobin. This disorder also leads to an abnormal accumulation of iron in red blood cells. The iron-loaded erythroblasts, which are present in bone marrow, are called ring sideroblasts. These abnormal cells give the condition its name. The signs and symptoms of X-linked sideroblastic anemia result from a combination of reduced hemoglobin and an overload of iron. They range from mild to severe and most often appear in young adulthood. Common features include fatigue, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, pale skin, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Over time, severe medical problems such as heart disease and liver damage (cirrhosis) can result from the buildup of excess iron in these organs. X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutation in the ALAS2 gene. In rare cases, mutations are found in both the HFE gene and the ALAS2 gene, resulting in a more severe form of X-linked sideroblastic anemia. X-linked sideroblastic anemia is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."

These bacteria are usually found in human intestines where they do not cause infections. To get a Klebsiella infection, a person must be exposed to the bacteria. For example, Klebsiella must enter the respiratory (breathing) tract to cause pneumonia, or the blood to cause a bloodstream infection. Most healthy people do not get Klebsiella infections. However, people who are hospitalized and receiving treatment for other conditions may be susceptible to these infections. Klebsiella bacteria are usually spread through person-to-person contact. In healthcare settings, people who require long courses of antibiotics and and people whose care requires the use of ventilators (breathing machines) or intravenous (vein) catheters are more at risk for Klebsiella infections. How are Klebsiella bacteria spread? To get a Klebsiella infection, a person must be exposed to the bacteria. For example, Klebsiella must enter the respiratory (breathing) tract to cause pneumonia or the blood to cause a bloodstream infection. In healthcare settings, Klebsiella bacteria can be spread through person-to-person contact or, less commonly, by contamination of the environment. It is not spread through the air. Patients in healthcare settings also may be exposed to Klebsiella when they are on ventilators (breathing machines), or have intravenous (vein) catheters or wounds (caused by injury or surgery). To prevent spreading Klebsiella infections between patients, healthcare personnel must follow specific infection control precautions. These precautions may include frequent hand washing and wearing gowns and gloves when entering the rooms of patients with Klebsiellarelated illnesses. Healthcare facilities should also follow strict cleaning procedures to prevent the spread of Klebsiella. If family members are healthy, they are at very low risk of acquiring a Klebsiella infection. It is still necessary to follow all precautions, particularly hand hygiene. Klebsiella bacteria are spread mostly by person-to-person contact and hand washing is the best way to prevent the spread of germs."

Chest x-rays or positron emission tomography (PET scan) may also be used to further evaluate infections that affect the lungs such as community-acquired pneumonia. When a Klebsiella infection is suspected, possible sites of infection including wounds, intravenous (vein) catheters, urinary catheters, and breathing machines should also be tested for the presence of Klebsiella bacteria."

            "answer": "How might Klebsiella infections be treated? The treatment of Klebsiella infections can be complicated since some Klebsiella bacteria are resistant to certain types of antibiotics. Once a person is diagnosed with one of these infections, a healthcare provider will usually order specialized laboratory testing (susceptibility testing) to determine which antibiotics may be used to treat the Klebsiella infection. If the healthcare provider prescribes an antibiotic, it is important to take the medication exactly as instructed and to continue taking the prescribed course, even if symptoms are gone. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and the person may become re-infected."

Eye symptoms may affect one or both eyes and may cause vision loss or blindness.  Other signs and symptoms may include abnormalities of the ears, teeth, hands, skeleton, urinary system and occasionally heart defects.  Around 60% of people with this condition have delayed development or intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe. Mutations in the BCOR gene cause some cases of Lenz microphthalmia syndrome.

            "question": "What is (are) Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a condition characterized by short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system.   Growth failure is often the first sign of this condition.  Other features are usually detected in the evaluation for growth failure or in the following years.  The severity of SIOD ranges from an infantile or severe early-onset form to a juvenile or milder late-onset form.  Complications of the severe form of SIOD can include strokes, severe opportunistic infections, bone marrow failure, and kidney failure that can be life-threatening early in life. People with milder disease have survived to adulthood if their kidney disease is managed. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene increase the risk to develop Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia.  However, in order for people with SMARCAL1 gene mutations to develop symptoms of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia, other currently unknown genetic or environmental factors must also be present."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia? Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia is characterized by short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system. In people with this condition, short stature is caused by flattened spinal bones (vertebrae), resulting in a shortened neck and trunk. Adult height is typically between 3 and 5 feet. Kidney (renal) disease often leads to life-threatening renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Affected individuals also have a shortage of certain immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. A shortage of T cells causes a person to be more susceptible to illness. Other features frequently seen in people with this condition include an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis); darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), typically on the chest and back; and a broad nasal bridge with a rounded tip of the nose. Less common signs and symptoms of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia include an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis), reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia), migraine-like headaches, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), decreased numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), underdeveloped hip bones (hypoplastic pelvis), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), a lack of sperm (azoospermia) in males, and irregular menstruation in females. In severe cases, many signs of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia can be present at birth. People with mild cases of this disorder may not develop signs or symptoms until late childhood.

Renal transplantation can treat the renal disease, and bone marrow transplantation has been done to treat the immunodeficiency.  Blood thinning medications can transiently improve blood flow through the atherosclerotic arteries but do not provide enduring relief from cerebral ischemia.  Treatment with acyclovir and some antibacterial agents has been beneficial for preventing of reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections.

            "answer": "Meningoencephalocele is a type of encephalocele, which is an abnormal sac of fluid, brain tissue, and meninges (membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord) that extends through a defect in the skull.  There are two main types of meningoencephalocele, which are named according to the location of the sac. The frontoethmoidal type is located at the frontal and ethmoid bones while the occipital type is located at the occipital bone.  Hydrocephalus, abnormalities of the eyeball and tear duct, and other findings have been associated with the condition. Some affected individuals have intellectual or physical disabilities while others have normal development and abilities.  The condition is typically congenital (present at birth) but has been reported to develop by chance in older individuals in rare cases. The underlying cause of the condition is uncertain, but environmental factors are thought to play a role. Treatment depends on the size, location and severity of the defect but mainly includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the severity of the defect, followed by surgery to repair it."

Some studies have suggested that environmental factors could play a role in causing the condition. Exposure during pregnancy to aflatoxins, toxins produced by a mold that grows in nuts, seeds, and legumes, has been proposed to be a possible cause in some cases. However, its potential role in causing the condition is unclear. It has also been suggested that folate deficiency during pregnancy might play a role, because the condition is so closely related to spina bifida, which can be caused by folate deficiency. However, there have been no studies regarding the relationship of maternal folate deficiency and meningoencephalocele. Further studies are needed to to clarify what may cause the condition."

Studies have proposed that meningoencephalocele is likely a multifactorial defect. This means that both environmental factors and multiple genes may interact with each other to cause the condition. Studies have suggested that environmental factors probably play an important role. This information is supported by the fact that several studies have not identified the condition among close relatives of affected individuals. To date, there have been no genes identified that are likely to play a strong part in causing the condition."

Scientists suspect that it may be due to decreased blood flow to the end of the affected bone, which may occur when repetitive episodes of minor injury and/or stress damage a bone overtime. In some families, osteochondritis dissecans is caused by changes (mutations) in the ACAN gene. In these cases, which are referred to as familial osteochondritis dissecans, the condition generally affects multiple joints and is also associated with short stature and early-onset osteoarthritis. The ACAN gene encodes a protein that is important to the structure of cartilage. Mutations in this gene weaken cartilage, which leads to the various signs and symptoms of familial osteochondritis disssecans."

            "question": "What is (are) Familial esophageal achalasia ?",
            "answer": "Familial esophageal achalasia refers to a cluster of achalasia within a family. Achalasia is a condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In people with achalasia, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus is reduced and the muscular valve where the esophagus and the stomach meet doesn't fully relax. This makes it difficult for food to move from the esophagus to the stomach. As a result, people with achalasia may experience regurgitation of food, chest pain, cough, difficulty swallowing, heartburn, and/or unintentional weight loss. Reports of familial esophageal achalasia are rare and represent less than 1% of all achalasia cases. In these families, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown, but it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment aims to allow food to pass more easily into this stomach and may include injections with botulinum toxin (Botox), certain medications and/or surgery."

            "answer": "Sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive is an inherited blood disorder that is characterized by an impaired ability of the bone marrow to produce normal red blood cells. The iron inside red blood cells is inadequately used to make hemoglobin, despite adequate or increased amounts of iron. Abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts are found in the blood of people with this anemia. It is caused by mutations in the SLC25A38 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Unlike other forms of sideroblastic anemia, this form is not responsive to vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)."

The symptoms of sideroblastic anemia are the same as for any anemia and iron overload. These may include fatigue, weakness, palpitations, shortness of breath, headaches, irritability, and chest pain. Physical findings may include pallor, tachycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, S3 gallop, jugular vein distension, and rales. Some people with sideroblastic anemia develop diabetes or abnormal glucose tolerance which may or may not be related to the degree of iron overload. The most dangerous complication of iron overload are heart arrhythmias and heart failure, which usually occur late in the course of the disease. In severely affected children, growth and development may be affected. In sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive the anemia generally remains stable over many years.

Currently there is not a cure for sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive, however with proper treatment the life-expectancy of people with this anemia can be close to normal. Treatments are aimed at preventing organ damage from iron overload, and controlling symptoms of anemia. People with severe anemia may require periodic transfusions. Transfusions of red cells are kept to a minimum, to avoid accelerating iron overload. Treatment of iron overload involves an iron depletion program, such as therapeutic phlebotomy or iron chelation. Total splenectomy is contraindicated in this disorder. This form of sideroblastic anemia is not associated with an increased risk for leukemia. A few small studies have described the use of allogenic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation for hereditary and congenital forms of sideroblastic anemia. While these therapies may offer the possibility of a cure, the complications associated with transplantation surgery must be considered. All patients with sideroblastic anemia should be followed by a hematologist and avoid alcohol."

            "answer": "Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is an inherited prion disease that affects the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), are a group of rare neurodegenerative conditions that occur when abnormal proteins clump together and accumulate in the brain, leading to tissue damage. The first symptoms of FFI usually begin in mid-life and may include insomnia that worsens over time and vivid dreams when sleep is achieved. These symptoms may be followed by high blood pressure; episodes of hyperventilation; excessive tearing; and/or sexual and urinary tract dysfunction. As the disease progresses, most affected people develop ataxia. FFI usually leads to death within a few months to a few years. Genetic prion diseases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by mutations in the PRNP gene. Treatment aims at alleviating symptoms when possible."

            "answer": "What causes fatal familial insomnia? Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is caused by a specific change (mutation) in the PRNP gene. PRNP encodes the prion protein. Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, scientists suspect that it plays an important role in the brain. Mutations in the PRNP gene result in an abnormal form of the protein that clumps together and accumulates in the brain. This leads to the destruction of neurons (brain cells) and creates tiny holes in the brain, which give the brain a \"sponge-like\" appearance when viewed under a microscope. The progressive loss of neurons leads to the many signs and symptoms of FFI."

            "answer": "How is fatal familial insomnia inherited? Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with FFI has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for fatal familial insomnia? Yes, genetic testing is available for PRNP, the gene known to cause fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is fatal familial insomnia diagnosed? A diagnosis of genetic prion disease is typically made based on a combination of the following: Various, adult-onset neurologic signs and symptoms Neuropathologic findings (diagnosis made by examining cells and tissues of the brain under a microscope) A family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance PRNP disease-causing mutation The PRNP gene is the only gene in which changes (mutations) are known to cause genetic prion diseases, including fatal familial insomnia. Finding a mutation in this gene is necessary to confirm a diagnosis in a person with symptoms. Testing of the PRNP gene may not detect all disease-causing mutations, so if a mutation is not found, a person may still have the disease. Other studies such as EEG, brain imaging, or examining cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful in supporting a diagnosis, but none of these can diagnose a genetic prion disease on its own."

CDKL5-related disorders have more commonly been reported in females. The inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Almost all reported cases have been due to a new mutation in the affected person; one family with 3 affected members has been described. Treatment is symptomatic. In the past, mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been found in people diagnosed with infantile spasms and/or West syndrome; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; Rett syndrome; a form of atypical Rett syndrome known as the early-onset seizure type; and autism.

Anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6 found in food). Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. This gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy? Those affected by pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy typically experience prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus). These seizures involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizures). Additional features of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy include low body temperature (hypothermia), poor muscle tone (dystonia) soon after birth, and irritability before a seizure episode. In rare instances, children with this condition do not have seizures until they are 1 to 3 years old.  If left untreated, people with this condition can develop severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). Even though seizures can be controlled with pyridoxine, neurological problems such as developmental delay and learning disorders may still occur. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

            "question": "What causes Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?",
            "answer": "What causes pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy? Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called -aminoadipic semialdehyde (-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. When antiquitin is deficient, a molecule that interferes with vitamin B6 function builds up in various tissues. Pyridoxine plays a role in many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the productions of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters). It is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. Some individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy do not have identified mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

            "answer": "Cone-rod dystrophies (CRDs) are a group of inherited eye disorders that affect both the cone and rod cells of the retina (photosenstitive receptor cells). In contrast to rod-cone dystrophies, individuals experience deterioration of the cone cells more severely than the rod cells. Initial signs and symptoms typically include decreased visual acuity when looking straight ahead (central vision loss); loss of color perception; and an abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). These signs are usually followed by progressive loss of peripheral vision and night blindness. Most cases occur due to mutations in any one of several genes, and CRDs can be inherited as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked or mitochondrial (maternally-inherited) traits. CRDs are usually non-syndromic, but they may also be part of several syndromes. Currently, there is no therapy that stops progression of the disease or restores vision; management aims at slowing the process, treating complications and helping individuals cope with the social and psychological impact of blindness."

There are four main types of epidermolysis bullosa: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Junctional epidermolysis bullosa Kindler Syndrome Identifying the exact type can be hard because there are many subtypes of EB. Within each type or subtype, a person may be mildly or severely affected. The disease can range from being a minor inconvenience to completely disabling, and fatal in some cases. Most types of EB are inherited. The inheritance pattern may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Management involves protecting the skin, reducing friction against the skin, and keeping the skin cool."

        {
            "question": "Is Epidermolysis bullosa inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is epidermolysis bullosa inherited? Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) may follow either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, depending on the type and subtype of inherited EB in the affected person. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (the most common type of EB) is mainly autosomal dominant, except for a few rare autosomal recessive subtypes. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, depending on the subtype present. However, dominant DEB is the second most common major type of EB. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa is autosomal recessive, although one article stated that an autosomal dominant form has recently been reported. Kindler syndrome is only inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A condition is autosomal dominant if having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from the affected parent. Many people with an autosomal dominant form of EB have an affected parent, but in some cases a mutation in the responsible gene occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of EB (called a de novo mutation). A person with a de novo mutation still has a 50% chance to pass the mutation on to each of his/her children. In autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. Typically, an affected person inherits one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene from each parent, who are referred to as carriers. Carriers usually do not have symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not be a carrier and not be affected. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (acquired EB) is a rare autoimmune disorder and is not inherited."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Epidermolysis bullosa ?",
            "answer": "How might infections in individuals with epidermolysis bullosa be treated? The chance of contracting a skin infection can be reduced by good nutrition, which builds the bodys defenses and promotes healing, and by careful skin care with clean hands and use of sterile materials. For added protection, a doctor may recommend antibiotic ointments and soaks. However, even in the presence of good care, it is possible for infection to develop. Signs of infection are redness and heat around an open area of skin, pus or a yellow drainage, excessive crusting on the wound surface, a red line or streak under the skin that spreads away from the blistered area, a wound that does not heal, and/or fever or chills. A doctor may prescribe a specific soaking solution, an antibiotic ointment, or an oral antibiotic to reduce the growth of bacteria. Wounds that are not healing may be treated by a special wound covering or biologically developed skin. More details about treatment, wound care and infection control can be obtained from the eMedicine and DEBRA web sites."

Affected people have progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity) in the legs; muscle wasting in the hands and feet; paraplegia; leg contractures; learning disorders; and short stature. Mood swings and mood disorders, causing inappropriate euphoria and/or crying, are common. Other features can include drooling; exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) in the legs; uncontrollable movements of the arms and legs (choreoathetosis); skeletal abnormalities; and a bending outward (valgus) of the knees.

            "answer": "What causes Troyer syndrome? Troyer syndrome is caused by mutations in the SPG20 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make a protein called spartin, which is present in many body tissues, including those of the nervous system. However, the function of this protein is not fully understood. It is thought to play various roles needed for the functions of cells. Troyer syndrome is assumed to be caused by a loss of function of the spartin protein. More research on the normal functions of the spartin protein is needed to better understand exactly how mutations in the SPG20 gene cause the features of Troyer syndrome."

This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has: a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."

Treatment aims to relieve symptoms of the disease and improve quality of life. Treatment for spasticity involves both exercise and medication, especially baclofen (Lioresal), which is used either orally or by intrathecal pump. Tizanidine, dantrolene (with precautions), and Botox have also been useful in reducing muscle spasticity. Daily physical therapy is recommended. Treatment may also include: Occupational therapy, assistive walking devices, and ankle-foot orthotics as needed Oxybutynin to reduce urinary urgency Antidepressants or mood stabilizers to manage emotional or mood disorders Additional information about the management of Troyer syndrome can be viewed on the GeneReviews Web site."

In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, and/or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as seizures, intellectual disability, breathing difficulties, and/or coma. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur after periods without food (fasting), episodes of hypoglycemia in people with familial hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating or exercising. Mutations in at least seven genes have been found to cause this condition. It is often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern or less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern."

            "answer": "Stickler syndrome is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders characterized by distinctive facial features, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. The features vary widely among affected people. Stickler syndrome type 1 may be divided into 2 subgroups: the membranous vitreous type and a predominantly ocular type. Both are caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. Stickler syndrome type II, sometimes called the beaded vitreous type, is caused by mutations in the COL11A1 gene. Stickler syndrome type III, sometimes called the nonocular form, is caused by mutations in the COL11A2 gene. These forms of Stickler syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Stickler syndrome type IV is caused by mutations in the COL9A1 gene, and Stickler syndrome type V is caused by mutations in the COL9A2 gene. These types of Stickler syndrome are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

DPD deficiency can have a wide range of severity; some individuals may have various neurological problems, while others have no signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms in severely affected individuals begin in infancy and may include seizures, intellectual disability, microcephaly, increased muscle tone (hypertonia), delayed motor skills, and autistic behavior.  All individuals with the condition, regardless of the presence or severity of symptoms, are at risk for severe, toxic reactions to drugs called fluoropyrimidines which are used to treat cancer. Individuals with no symptoms may be diagnosed only by laboratory testing or after exposure to fluoropyrimidines. DPD deficiency is caused by mutations in the DPYD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

            "answer": "What causes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency? DPD deficiency is caused by mutations in the DPYD gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is involved in the breakdown of molecules called uracil and thymine. Uracil and thymine are building blocks of DNA, RNA, and molecules that serve as energy sources in cells. Mutations in the DPYD gene result in deficiencies (to various degrees) of functional DPD, interfering with the breakdown of uracil and thymine in cells. This results in excessive amounts of uracil and thymine in the blood, urine, and the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is currently poorly understood exactly how this cascade of events causes the signs and symptoms of the condition."

        {
            "question": "Is Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency inherited? Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that in affected individuals, both copies of the DPYD gene in each cell (one inherited from each parent) have mutations. The mutations that cause DPD deficiency vary widely in severity; therefore, some people with 2 mutated copies of the gene may have signs and symptoms of the condition, while others may be asymptomatic. However, all individuals with 2 mutations are at risk for toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs. Individuals who carry one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene (including most parents of affected individuals) are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs and symptoms of the condition. However, people with one mutated copy of the DPYD gene may still experience toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidine drugs. When 2 carriers for the same autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier. A child of one carrier parent has a 50% risk to also be a carrier."

            "answer": "How is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency diagnosed? DPD deficiency may be diagnosed in various ways. In individuals with complete or profound DPD deficiency, laboratory testing can detect elevated levels of uracil and/or thymine in plasma or urine. Partial DPD deficiency is more difficult to detect, which has led to the development of a radioenzymatic test for the DPD enzyme. This test has remained the gold standard for diagnosing DPD deficiency even after the development of genetic testing for the condition, because of the complexity of the DPYD gene and the presence of multiple DNA sequence variations present in most affected individuals. Various types of cells and tissues can be examined this way. More recently, a rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective breath test was developed. This test permits the evaluation of DPD activity (normal activity and partial or profound deficiency) before the administration of fluoropyrmidine drugs such as 5-FU."

Some individuals experience no symptoms, while others may develop hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, bile duct obstruction, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, or other conditions. Hyperglycemia has been shown to be present in approximately 50% of affected individuals. The cause of agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is currently not well understood. It may occur in individuals with no history of the condition in the family (sporadically) and in some cases, autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant inheritance has been suggested.

Partial or complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas results from the failure of the dorsal pancreatic bud to form the body and tail of the pancreas in the developing fetus. It may occur from the absence, or regression of, the dorsal bud during fetal development. Heredity may play a role in the development of this condition, but further research is needed to clarify this. There have been reports in the literature of the condition being associated (rarely) with other congenital diseases, specifically a very rare disorder called polysplenia/heterotaxy syndrome. In this case, it may occur due to errors in development of the asymmetric organs and may be associated with benign to severe congenital cardiac (heart) malformations."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas ?",
            "answer": "How might agenesis of the dorsal pancreas be treated? Because agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is considered rare and few cases have been reported in the literature, there is limited information about how the condition as a whole might be treated or managed. However, there is current information about how some of the signs and symptoms associated with agenesis of the dorsal pancreas (such as pancreatitis) may be managed. For pancreatitis, individuals may be able to make themselves more comfortable during an attack, but they will most likely continue to have attacks until treatment is received for the underlying cause of the symptoms (when possible). If symptoms are mild, people might try the following preventive measures: stopping all alcohol consumption; adopting a liquid diet consisting of foods such as broth, gelatin, and soups (these simple foods may allow the inflammation process to get better); over-the-counter pain medications; and avoiding pain medications that can affect the liver (such as acetaminophen). Medical treatment is usually focused on relieving symptoms and preventing further aggravation to the pancreas. Certain complications of either acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis may require surgery or a blood transfusion. In acute pancreatitis, the choice of treatment is based on the severity of the attack. Most people who are having an attack of acute pancreatitis are admitted to the hospital for oxygen (if having trouble breathing) and an intravenous (IV) line for medications and fluids. If needed, medications for pain and nausea may be prescribed. It may be recommended that no food or liquid is taken by mouth for a few days (this is called bowel rest). Some people may need a nasogastric (NG) tube to remove stomach juices which rests the intestine further, helping the pancreas recover. If the attack lasts longer than a few days, nutritional supplements may be administered through an IV line. In chronic pancreatitis, treatment focuses on relieving pain and avoiding further aggravation to the pancreas. Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) management may depend on the exact cause if the condition in the affected individual. Management may include checking blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter; checking urine for ketones; and adopting strategies to lower blood sugar level. Strategies might include exercise (only if urine ketones are not present); diet as discussed with a diabetes health educator or registered dietitian; and/or medication (especially if diet and exercise are not keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range) which may include insulin and/or other medications. Individuals seeking treatment options for themselves or others should speak with their health care provider about an individualized treatment plan; the information here is provided for general educational purposes only."

Affected individuals are also born with abnormalities of the head and facial area (craniofacial abnormalities), resulting in a distinctive facial appearance. Affected infants typically have a small head (microcephaly), a high forehead, a broad bridge of the nose, thin nostrils, an abnormally thin upper lip, and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism). Filippi syndrome is also characterized by mild to severe intellectual disability; some affected individuals may have abnormal language and speech development, potentially resulting in an inability to speak. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes have also been reported. These may include webbing or fusion of the fingers and toes (syndactyly). The severity of the syndactyly may be variable, ranging from webbing of skin and other soft tissues to fusion of bone within the affected fingers or toes. Affected individuals can also have extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly). In addition, the fingers and toes may appear unusually short (brachydactyly), particularly due to abnormalities of the bones within the hands and feet. Some individuals may have additional physical abnormalities including delayed bone age, incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), and a dislocated elbow.

            "answer": "Benign rolandic epilepsy is the most common form of childhood epilepsy.  It is referred to as \"benign\" because most children outgrow the condition by puberty, usually by 14 years of age.  This form of epilepsy is characterized by seizures involving the part of the frontal lobe of the brain called the rolandic area. The seizures associated with this condition typically occur during the nighttime.  Treatment is usually not prescribed, since the condition tends to disappear by puberty."

The episodes usually begin with twitching and stiffness of the face, and often wake up the child.  The clonic activity causes a tingling feeling on one side of the mouth involving the tongue, lips, gum and inner side of the cheek.  The seizure may also involve the throat which may make speech unclear and difficult to understand.   Occasionally, both sides of the body may be affected, which can lead to loss of consciousness causing stiffness and jerking movements of the arms and legs.  The child may also be incontinent.  After an episode, a child may be sleepy and doze for a few hours. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE).

It is spread from person to person by mosquitoes. Most infected people are asymptomatic and never develop clinical symptoms. A small percentage of people develop lymphedema, which may affect the legs, arms, breasts, and genitalia; bacterial infections that cause hardening and thickening of the skin, called elephantiasis; hydrocele (swelling of the scrotum) in men; and pulmonary tropical eosinophilia syndrome. Treatment may include a yearly dose of medicine, called diethylcarbamazine (DEC); while this drug does not kill all of the adult worms, it prevents infected people from giving the disease to someone else."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the treatments for Lymphatic filariasis ?",
            "answer": "How might lymphatic filariasis be treated? The main treatment for this disorder is the use of major anti-parasiticide drugs; examples of these include ivermectin, albendazole, and diethylcarbamazine (DEC). These drugs work to get rid of the larval worm, to inhibit reproduction of the adult worm, or to kill the adult worm. For individuals who are actively infected with the filarial parasite, DEC is typically the drug of choice in the United States. The drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms. DEC has been used world-wide for more than 50 years. Because this infection is rare in the U.S., the drug is no longer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cannot be sold in the United.States. Physicians can typically obtain the medication from the CDC after confirmed positive lab results. DEC is generally well tolerated. Side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints. Another treatment option, ivermectin, kills only the microfilariae. For individuals with clinical symptoms of the condition, treatment depends on the signs and symptoms the affected individual has. Lymphedema and elephantiasis are not typically indications for DEC treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite. To prevent the lymphedema from getting worse, individuals should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene, exercise and treatment of wounds. Men with hydrocele (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the scrotum) may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with DEC. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery. Surgery may also be performed to remove the remains of adult worms and calcifications developing around them. Treatment of elephantiasis of the legs usually consists of elevation and support from elastic stockings. In the tropical areas of the world, mosquito control is an important part of prevention of filariasis. Filariasis is usually a self-limited disease unless reinfection occurs. Therefore some cases, especially those brought into temperate regions of the world (i.e., North America), may be left untreated because there is no danger of spreading the disease."

            "answer": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome observed in some patients with cirrhosis. It is defined as a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver dysfunction, when other known brain disease has been excluded. Signs and symptoms may be debilitating, and they can begin mildly and gradually, or occur suddenly and severely. They may include personality or mood changes, intellectual impairment, abnormal movements, a depressed level of consciousness, and other symptoms. There are several theories regarding the exact cause, but development of the condition is probably at least partially due to the effect of substances that are toxic to nerve tissue (neurotoxic), which are typically present with liver damage and/or liver disease. Treatment depends upon the severity of mental status changes and upon the certainty of the diagnosis."

            "answer": "Is hepatic encephalopathy inherited? Hepatic encephalopathy is not an inherited condition, so an individual who has it cannot pass it on to his/her children. It is brought on by chronic liver failure, particularly in alcoholics with cirrhosis. Although there are many theories and possibilities regarding what exactly causes HE, it is thought that one of the main causes is the accumulation of ammonia in the blood, which the liver, damaged by alcoholic liver disease, cannot remove. Researchers have found that ammonia alters the expression of certain genes; the genes that may be affected carry instructions for brain proteins. When the instructions in these genes are not \"followed\" correctly by the body due to the altered expression of the genes, the cells in the brain can no longer function normally, which may contribute to the signs and symptoms of HE. However, the genes themselves are not changed in such a way that these changes are passed down to an individual's children."

Affected individuals may also have vision loss caused by a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. Other features of NARP include learning disabilities, developmental delay, seizures, dementia, hearing loss, and cardiac conduction defects. Mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene cause NARP syndrome. This gene is located within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Most individuals with NARP have a specific MT-ATP6 mutation in 70 percent to 90 percent of their mitochondria.

            "answer": "Cytochrome C oxidase deficiency (COX deficiency) is a condition that can affect several parts of the body including the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and liver. The range and severity of signs and symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals (even within the same family) and depend on the form of the condition present. Features in mildly affected individuals may include muscle weakness and hypotonia; in more severely affected individuals, brain dysfunction; heart problems; an enlarged liver; lactic acidosis; and/or a specific group of features known as Leigh syndrome may also be present. COX deficiency is caused by mutations in any of at least 14 genes; the inheritance pattern depends on the gene involved. The condition is frequently fatal in childhood, but mildly affected individuals may survive into adolescence or adulthood."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency? There are currently 4 known forms of COX deficiency. The range and severity of signs and symptoms can vary widely from case to case. In one form, referred to as the benign infantile mitochondrial myopathy type, symptoms may be limited to the skeletal muscles. Episodes of lactic acidosis may occur and can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated. However, with appropriate treatment, individuals with this form of the condition may spontaneously recover within the first few years of life. In the second form of the disorder, referred to as the infantile mitochondrial myopathy type, the skeletal muscles as well as several other tissues (such as the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and/or connective tissue) are affected. Symptoms associated with this form typically begin within the first few weeks of life and may include muscle weakness; heart problems; kidney dysfunction; failure to thrive; difficulties sucking, swallowing, and/or breathing; and/or hypotonia. Affected infants may also have episodes of lactic acidosis. The third form of COX deficiency is thought to be a systemic form of the condition and is referred to as Leigh's disease. This form is characterized by progressive degeneration of the brain as well as dysfunction of several other organs including the heart, kidneys, muscles, and/or liver. Symptoms of this form, which predominantly involve the central nervous system, may begin between three months and two years of age and may include loss of previously acquired motor skills and/or head control; poor sucking ability; loss of appetite; vomiting; irritability; and possible seizures. Intellectual disability may also occur. In the fourth form of COX deficiency, the French-Canadian type, the brain (as in Leigh's disease) and liver are particularly affected in addition to the skeletal muscles and connective tissues. However, in this form, the kidneys and heart appear to have near-normal enzyme activity. Individuals with this form may have developmental delay; hypotonia; slight facial abnormalities; Leigh's disease; strabismus; ataxia; liver degeneration; and/or episodes of lactic acidosis. Although some mildly affected individuals survive into adolescence or adulthood, this condition is often fatal in childhood.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency ?",
            "answer": "How might cytochrome C oxidase deficiency be treated? There is currently no cure for cytochrome C oxidase (COX) deficiency. Management of all forms of COX deficiency generally focuses on the specific symptoms present in the affected individual and is largely supportive. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and slow progression of the disease; the effectiveness of treatment varies with each individual. Treatment generally does not reverse any damage that has already occurred. Prognosis varies depending on the form of COX deficiency present. Individuals with benign infantile mitochondrial myopathy may experience spontaneous recovery (although early diagnosis and intensive treatment is still needed until this point), while there may be rapid demise in individuals with Leigh syndrome. It is often recommended that individuals with mitochondrial disorders such as COX deficiency avoid fasting. Dehydration due to vomiting or illness may be treated with intravenous fluid if the individual is not able to take fluids orally. Seizures are typically controlled with anticonvulsants. Some affected individuals may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapies that are specifically tailored to their needs. Dietary supplements including certain vitamins and cofactors have shown varying degrees of benefit in individual cases. Individuals interested in specific management recommendations for themselves or relatives should speak with their healthcare providers."

Symptoms, which typically present during the first year of life, include severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle stiffness, difficulty moving, and involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis). This condition may also cause infants to lack energy, feed poorly, startle easily, and have sleep disturbances. Many people with AADC deficiency exprience episodes called oculogyric crises (also called \"spells\" or \"attacks\"), which are characterized by abnormal rotation of the eyeballs, extreme irritability and agitation, pain, muscle spasms, and uncontrolled movements of the head and neck.. These episodes can last for many hours and can be times of extreme concern for caregivers and family members. AADC deficiency may also affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes like regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. Autonomic symptoms may include droopy eye lids (ptosis), constriction of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), inappropriate or impaired sweating, nasal congestion, drooling, reduced ability to control body temperature, low blood pressure (hypotension), gastroesophageal reflux, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), fainting (syncope), and cardiac arrest.

            "answer": "What causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy? Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene. The PABPN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active (expressed) throughout the body. In cells, the PABPN1 protein plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. The protein acts to protect the mRNA from being broken down and allows it to move within the cell. Mutations in the PABPN1 gene that cause OPMD result in a PABPN1 protein that forms clumps within muscle cells, and hence they cannot be broken down. These clumps are thought to impair the normal function of muscle cells and eventually cause cells to die. The progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with OPMD. It is not known why abnormal PABPN1 proteins seem to affect muscle cells in only certain parts of the body."

Severe drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) may be treated with plastic surgery on the eyelid (blepharoplasty). The goal of this surgery is to raise the eyelid so that the affected individual can see. Individuals with severe difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) may have a surgical procedure known as cricopharyngeal myotomy. In this procedure, the cricopharyngeal muscle of the throat is cut so that when swallowing occurs, the muscle remains relaxed allowing the passage of food or liquid. Orthopedic devices such as canes, leg braces, or walkers can assist individuals who have difficulty walking. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."

            "question": "What is (are) Danon disease ?",
            "answer": "Danon disease is a type of lysosomal storage disorder. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that the cell can use. In Danon disease there is a defect in the wall (membrane) of the lysosome. The defect is caused by mutations in the LAMP2 gene. Danon disease is chiefly characterized by cardiomyopathy (heart disease), although other signs and symptoms may occur as well. Danon disease is inherited in an X-linked fashion, as a result males tend to be more severely affected than females. Females who carry the LAMP2 gene mutation may or may not develop signs and symptoms."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Danon disease ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Danon disease? Danon disease is characterized by cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy causes the heart muscle to enlarge or become thicker and more rigid than normal. This may make the heart less able to pump blood through the body and can cause serious complications, including sudden death. People with danon disease may also manifest with high levels of serum creatine kinase, eye/vision abnormalities, or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). Men with Danon disease tend to develop cardiomyopathy prior to the age of 20, and sometimes in early childhood. Women with Danon disease tend to develop cardiomyopathy later in adulthood, however cases of cardiomyopathy in young girls have been reported in the medical literature.  Some women who carry LAMP2 gene mutation never develop any or only very minor symptoms. The following additional signs and symptoms are variably present in people with Danon disease: Learning and development (primarily reported in males, however there has been at least one report of an affected female) Mild intellectual ability Mental retardation Attention deficit disorder Skeletal muscle Exercise intolerance Muscle weakness Eye and vision Peripheral pigmentary retinopathy Lens changes Nearsightedness Abnormal visual fields Signs and symptoms of Danon disease can be very similar to those of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, even though the underlying disease process differs.

Because Danon disease can be associated with rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy and sudden death, careful monitoring of heart disease is required. Aggressive interventions may be recommended for people showing signs of progressive heart failure (e.g., early intervention with heart transplantation or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). However, the severity of cardiomyopathy does vary, particularly in females. Management will depend on the presence and severity of the heart disease, and will be tailored to the needs of the patient."

Scarring of the affected  mucosa of the eye may lead to blindness and tends to be the most feared complication. A combination of environmental and genetic factors appear to play a role in the susceptibility of developing cicatricial pemphigoid. Although the specific causes of this condition have not been identified, it is considered an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens such as BP180, BP230, and laminin 5.

Sporadic abnormalities are not inherited from a parent and are not likely to recur in a family. Familial cases of isolated astrocytomas are very rare. Although most individuals with a pilocytic astrocytoma do not have an underlying genetic condition, astrocytomas have been associated with a few \"predisposing\" genetic syndromes. Individuals with these syndromes will not necessarily develop one; these tumors just occur with a greater frequency in affected individuals. Genetic syndromes in which astrocytomas have been reported to occur include: neurofibromatosis type 1 Turcot syndrome Li-Fraumeni syndrome tuberous sclerosis All of these genetic conditions follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

Signs and symptoms of the disorder may include constrictive pericarditis; low birth weight; short stature; severe progressive growth delays; hypotonia; hepatomegaly; and yellow discoloration of the eyes in infancy. It is caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment may include surgery for constrictive pericarditis, medications for progressive heart failure and hormone replacement therapy."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Mulibrey Nanism ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Mulibrey Nanism? Mulibrey nanism (MN) is characterized by progressive growth failure that begins prenatally (before birth). Hypotonia (poor muscle tone) is common. Newborns often have characteristic abnormalities of the head and face, including a triangularly shaped face. Yellow discoloration of the eyes and other ocular abnormalities may be present, but vision is usually normal. More than 90 percent of affected individuals have a J-shaped sella turcica, which is a depression in the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull. Infants with mulibrey nanism may also have symptoms related to overgrowth of the fibrous sac surrounding the heart (constrictive pericarditis). When constrictive pericarditis is present at birth, affected infants may have a bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), especially on the lips and fingertips. Individuals with MN typically have a high-pitched voice. Other symptoms may include abnormally prominent veins in the neck, congestion in the lungs, abnormal fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), swelling of the arms and/or legs (peripheral edema), and/or enlargement of the heart (cardiac hypertrophy) and/or liver (hepatomegaly). There may also be elevated pressure in the veins, congestion or blockage in the main artery serving the lungs (pulmonary artery), and/or a build-up of fibrous tissue in the walls of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis). Associated complications of these conditions may lead to congestive heart failure. In some cases, individuals with mulibrey nanism may have additional physical abnormalities, such as an unusually thin shinbone (fibrous tibia dysplasia). Large cerebral ventricles in the brain and delayed motor development are uncommon findings. Most affected individuals have normal intelligence. Individuals with mulibrey nanism often have underdevelopment of various endocrine glands, that leads to hormone deficiencies. Delayed puberty sometimes occurs, accompanied by infrequent or very light menstrual periods. Females have an increased risk for premature ovarian failure and ovarian tumors.

The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "answer": "Juvenile temporal arteritis is a rare form of vasculitis, a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. Unlike the classic form of temporal arteritis, this condition is generally diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood and only affects the temporal arteries (located at the lower sides of the skull, directly underneath the temple). Affected people often have no signs or symptoms aside from a painless nodule or lump in the temporal region. The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. It generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Juvenile temporal arteritis is often treated with surgical excision and rarely recurs."

            "answer": "Developmental dysphasia is a language disorder that develops in children. The disorder typically involves difficulties speaking and understanding spoken words. The symptoms cannot be attributed to sensorimotor, intellectual deficits, autism spectrum, or other developmental impairments. Likewise it does not occur as the consequence of an evident brain lesion or as a result of the child's social environment. Familial cases of developmental dyphasia have been described. In these families, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."

            "answer": "Childhood ovarian cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the ovaries. The childhood form, specifically, is extremely rare and accounts for less than 5% of all ovarian cancer cases. The most common types of ovarian cancers diagnosed in children and adolescents include germ cell tumors, followed by epithelial tumors, stromal tumors, and then other tumors (such as Burkitt lymphoma and small cell carcinoma of the ovary). Many people with early ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include painful menstrual periods; an abdominal lump; pain or swelling in the abdomen; having male sex traits (i.e. body hair or a deep voice); and/or early signs of puberty. The underlying cause of childhood ovarian cancer is often unknown. Certain inherited conditions, such as Ollier disease, Maffucci syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are associated with an increased risk of developing childhood ovarian cancer. Treatment varies based on many factors including the type of ovarian tumor and the severity of the condition. It may include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy."

            "answer": "Cerulean cataracts are opaque areas that develop in the lens of the eye that often have a bluish or whitish color. They may be present at birth or develop in very early childhood, but may not be diagnosed until adulthood. They are usually bilateral and progressive. Infants can be asymptomatic, but may also be visually impaired from birth and develop nystagmus and amblyopia. In adulthood, the cataracts may progress, making lens removal necessary. Cerulean cataracts may be caused by mutations in several genes, including the CRYBB2, CRYGD, and MAF genes, and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. No treatment is known to prevent cerulean cataracts, but frequent evaluations and cataract surgery are typically required to prevent amblyopia as the opacities progress."
