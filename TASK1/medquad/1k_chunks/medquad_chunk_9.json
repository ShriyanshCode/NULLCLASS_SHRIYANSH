The signs and symptoms of Partington syndrome vary but may include: Mild to moderate intellectual disability Behavioral issues Dystonia, especially affecting the movement of the hands Dysarthria Abnormal gait (style of walking) Recurrent seizures Partington syndrome usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Partington syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Delayed speech and language development - Dysarthria - EEG abnormality - Flexion contracture - Focal dystonia - Intellectual disability - Limb dystonia - Lower limb spasticity - Seizures - Triangular face - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

            "question": "What causes Partington syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Partington syndrome? Partington syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARX gene, which encodes a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. This protein is particularly important in the developing brain where it plays many roles (i.e. assisting with the movement and communication of neurons). Specific changes in the ARX gene impair the function of the protein, which may disrupt normal neuronal migration. This can lead to the many signs and symptoms associated with Partington syndrome."

            "question": "Is Partington syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is Partington syndrome inherited? Partington syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). Women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome. In X-linked recessive conditions, men develop the condition if they inherit one gene mutation (they have only one X chromosome). Females are generally only affected if they have two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes), although some females may rarely have a mild form of the condition if they only inherit one mutation. A woman with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. This means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers. A man with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters (carriers) and none of his sons."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Partington syndrome ?",
            "answer": "How might Partington syndrome be treated? The treatment of Partington syndrome is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, dystonia of the hands and other parts of the body may be treated with a variety of therapies including medications and/or physical therapy. Speech therapy may be recommended for children with dysarthria. Medications may be prescribed to help prevent and/or control recurrent seizures. Children with mild to moderate intellectual disability may benefit from special education services. For personalized information about the treatment and management of Partington syndrome, please speak to a healthcare provider."

Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) may affect multiple parts of the body but primarily affects the head and face. People with MFDM are usually born with a small head (microcephaly) which does not grow at the same rate as the body. Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe and is present in almost all affected people. Speech and language problems are also common. Facial abnormalities in affected people may include underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the midface and cheekbones; a small lower jaw (micrognathia); small and malformed ears; facial asymmetry; and cleft palate. Other head and facial features may include a metopic ridge; up- or downslanting palpebral fissures; a prominent glabella (space between the eyebrows); a broad nasal bridge; a bulbous nasal tip; and an everted lower lip. Abnormalities of the ear canal, ear bones, or inner ear often lead to hearing loss. Affected people can also have a blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia) that can cause respiratory problems. Other signs and symptoms in some people with MFDM may include esophageal atresia, congenital heart defects, thumb anomalies, and/or short stature. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

            "question": "What causes Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly ?",
            "answer": "What causes mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly? Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is caused by mutations in the EFTUD2 gene. This gene gives the body instructions for making part of spliceosomes, which help process a type of RNA- a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. Mutations in EFTUD2 impair the production or function of the enzyme from the gene, which impairs the processing of mRNA. However, at this time, it is not clear how this process causes the specific symptoms of MFDM."

            "question": "Is Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly inherited? Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having one mutated copy of the responsible gene in each cell of the body is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. Most cases of MFDM are due to new mutations that occur for the first time in the affected person (called de novo mutations), and are not inherited from a parent. In other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from a parent. The parent may be mildly affected or may be unaffected. Sometimes, an unaffected parent has the mutation only in some or all of their sperm or egg cells (not their body cells), which is known as germline mosaicism."

            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly? Yes. Genetic testing is available for mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) and confirms the diagnosis in virtually all people suspected of having MFDM. There are two approaches to genetic testing for this condition. One is sequence analysis of the EFTUD2 gene to identify a mutation (which detects ~91% of affected people), and the other is deletion analysis (which detects ~9%), for people in whom sequencing does not detect a mutation. When a diagnosis of MFDM is strongly suspected but genetic testing is inconclusive, a clinical diagnosis may still be appropriate. However, given the high sensitivity of genetic testing for this condition, other disorders with overlapping features should first be carefully considered. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."

Signs and symptoms may include scotomata, blurred vision, photopsias, floaters, photophobia, distorted vision (metamorphopsia), and/or loss of peripheral vision. The majority of cases are self-limited with good visual prognosis, but permanent and severe visual loss can occur as a result of the development of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV). The cause of PIC is not known, but it is thought to involve both genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The majority of affected individuals who do not have CNV do not require treatment; for others, treatment may include medication, laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy (treatment with drugs that become active when exposed to light) and/or surgery."

The term thoracic outlet syndrome is not a specific diagnosis, but refers to a group of conditions, namely neurogenic (nTOS), venous (vTOS), and arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (aTOS). While collectively TOS is not thought to be rare, individual sub-types may be. The most common type (95% of cases) is nTOS which is caused from brachial plexus compression.  Symptoms of nTOS include shoulder and arm numbness, abnormal sensations and weakness. vTOS may cause deep vein thrombosis and swelling; and aTOS can cause blood clots, arm pain with exertion, or acute arterial thrombosis (sudden blood flood obstruction in an artery). Diagnosis of TOS can be very difficult and diagnosis is often delayed.

Cervical ribs can affect one or both sides of the neck, and may cause thoracic outlet syndrome by putting pressure on an artery.  Currently, the cause of cervical ribs is not known. In general, both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. There have been animal studies investigating the role of HOX genes in causing extra ribs. Studies have also suggested environmental exposures, such as maternal exposure to foreign chemicals or stress during pregnancy could play a role. Further research in this area is needed. There have been rare case reports of families with multiple members with cervical rib. In these families autosomal dominant inheritance was suspected.

Most experts agree that the initial abnormality occurs in the distal bronchi (air tubes that bring air to and from the lungs) after an infection during early childhood. The smaller size of the affected lung may be due to the infection inhibiting the normal growth of the lung. A number of reports have described Swyer-James syndrome following childhood histories including radiation therapy; measles; pertussis (whooping cough); tuberculosis; breathing in a foreign body; mycoplasma; and viral infections, especially adenovirus. Research has suggested that a hyper-immune reaction in the lung (producing an unusual abundance of antibodies) may play a role in sustaining airway damage after the initial infection. Some have argued a pre-existing lung abnormality may predispose individuals to the condition. Although bronchial damage of some kind during childhood is generally considered to play an important role, many affected individuals have had no known history of an airway infection.

There have been reports of affected individuals being treated with pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), lobectomy (removal of one or more lobes of a lung) or segmentectomy (removal of a specific segment). It has been proposed that individuals with Swyer-James syndrome may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), a procedure in which damaged tissue is removed from the lung. LVRS was reportedly performed successfully in an individual with Swyer-James syndrome, and it has been suggested that the procedure could be used for managing the condition in other affected individuals because it has shown to be effective for improving pulmonary function and symptoms."

            "answer": "How is alpha-thalassemia x-linked intellectual disability syndrome inherited? Alpha-thalassemia x-linked intellectual disability (ATRX) syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ATRX gene and is inherited in an x-linked way.  The chance that a relative may have ATRX syndrome depends on whether the mutation in the first affected family member was inherited from his mother or happened by chance (a de novo mutation).  If the mutation happened by chance, there is very little risk that other relatives could be affected by this condition.  If the mutation was inherited from his mother, each of his mother's sisters has a 50% of being a carrier of ATRX syndrome.  If a woman is a carrier of an ATRX mutation, she has a 25% chance of having a son with the mutation who is affected with ATRX syndrome; a 25% chance of having a son who does not have the mutation and does not have ATRX syndrome; a 25% chance of having a daughter with the mutation who is a carrier of ATRX syndrome; and a 25% chance of having a daughter who does not have the mutation and is not a carrier."

Less commonly, the nodules form on other areas of the body such as the thighs and forearms. The lesions begin as firm, hot, red, painful lumps and progress to a purplish color. EN is a type of inflammatory disorder affecting the layer of fat under the skin (panniculitis). Other symptoms that may accompany the skin findings include the following: fever, a general feeling of being ill. joint aches, and swelling of the affected area. In many cases, EN is presumed to be a delayed reaction to antigens associated with various infections, drugs, and certain systemic diseases. In many cases, however, EN has no identifiable cause (idiopathic); in these cases, clinical follow-up is needed to rule out certain conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and Behcet's disease. Treatment may include rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), steroids, hot or cold compresses, potassium iodide solution, and supportive bandages or compression stockings. Symptoms usually resolve within six weeks, but EN may become a chronic disorder lasting for months and, occasionally, for years. Approximately 30% cases of idiopathic EN may last more than 6 months."

Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. MPS IIIB is caused by alterations (mutations) in the NAGLU gene. This gene provides the instructions for producing an enzyme called N-alpha-acetylglucosaminidase, which is needed to completely break down heparan sulfate.

The bacterium responsible for this disease is typically Fusobacterium necrophorum, although a wide variety of bacteria have been reported as causing the disease.  The bacterial infection begins in the oropharynx then spreads through the lymphatic vessels. Following this primary infection, thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) develops. The final phase of the disease occurs when septic emboli (pus-containing tissue) migrate from their original location in the body to various organs. The lungs are most commonly involved, however other sites may include the joints, muscle, skin and soft tissue, liver, and spleen.  The symptoms of Lemierre syndrome include fever, sore throat, neck swelling, pulmonary involvement and joint pain. It is an uncommon disease that occurs in about one person per million per year. The disease primarily affects healthy young people before age 40. Diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome rests on the presence of a blood clot (or clots) in the IJV and blood cultures that show the presence of Fusobacterium necrophorum. Intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment."

As the syndrome progresses, there is neck pain and tender swelling along the internal jugular vein.[ If undiagnosed, the next stage is the \"metastasis\" of septic emboli to the lungs, abdominal organs, brain or heart. Lung involvement typically results in a productive cough (a cough that brings up mucus or phlegm) and chest pain. Girls may report abdominal pain and have enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and jaundice, all of which indicate involvement of the liver."

            "answer": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is one of a group of disorders (collectively called congenital adrenal hyperplasia) that affect the adrenal glands. In this condition, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens (male sex hormones). This condition is caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. There are two types, the classic form and the non-classic form. Females with the classic form have ambiguous external genitalia with normal internal reproductive organs. Males and females with the classic form have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics (precocious puberty). The early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. About two-thirds of individuals with the classic form have high blood pressure which develops in the first year of life."

            "answer": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder in which a defect in the small tubes (tubules) in the kidneys causes a person to pass a large amount of urine. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney tubules, which allow water to be removed from the body or reabsorbed, do not respond to a chemical in the body called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin. ADH normally tells the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated. As a result of the defect, the kidneys release an excessive amount of water into the urine, producing a large quantity of very dilute urine. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or hereditary. The acquired form is brought on by certain drugs and chronic diseases and can occur at any time during life. The hereditary form is caused by genetic mutations, and its signs and symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of life."

When nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from mutations in the AVPR2 gene, the condition has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. The AVPR2 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation usually has to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, some females who carry a single mutated copy of the AVPR2 gene have features of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, including polyuria and polydipsia. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons."

            "answer": "Optic atrophy 1 is a condition that mainly affects vision, but may include other features. Vision loss typically begins within the first decade of life; severity varies widely among affected people (from nearly normal vision to complete blindness), even among members of the same family. Vision problems may include difficulty distinguishing colors, progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the optic nerve. Additional, less common abnormalities may include sensorineural hearing loss, ataxia, myopathy (muscle disease) and other neurological findings. It is usually caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene, although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in this gene, in which case the cause of the condition is unknown.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis involves attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (paralysis) that come and go. The weakness or paralysis is most commonly located in the shoulders and hips, affecting the muscles of the arms and legs. Muscles of the eyes and those that help you breathe and swallow may also be affected. There is normal muscle strength between attacks.  Attacks usually begin in adolescence, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day, while others have them once a year. Episodes of muscle weakness usually last between a few hours and a day. Attacks can occur without warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral illness, or certain medications. Often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal, alcohol, or vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following morning. Although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength between attacks, repeated episodes can lead to persistent muscle weakness later in life. People with hypokalemic periodic paralysis have reduced levels of potassium in their blood (hypokalemia) during episodes of muscle weakness. Researchers are investigating how low potassium levels may be related to the muscle abnormalities in this condition. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypokalemic periodic paralysis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What causes Hypokalemic periodic paralysis ?",
            "answer": "What causes hypokalemic periodic paralysis? Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is caused by mutations in the CACNA1S and SCN4A genes. The CACNA1S and SCN4A genes provide instructions for making proteins that play an essential role in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain positively charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. The CACNA1S and SCN4A proteins form channels that control the flow of these ions. The channel formed by the CACNA1S protein transports calcium ions into cells, while the channel formed by the SCN4A protein transports sodium ions. Mutations in the CACNA1S or SCN4A gene alter the usual structure and function of calcium or sodium channels. The altered channels cannot properly regulate the flow of ions into muscle cells, which reduces the ability of skeletal muscles to contract. Because muscle contraction is needed for movement, a disruption in normal ion transport leads to episodes of severe muscle weakness or paralysis. A small percentage of people with the characteristic features of hypokalemic periodic paralysis do not have identified mutations in the CACNA1S or SCN4A gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown."

            "question": "Is Hypokalemic periodic paralysis inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is hypokalemic periodic paralysis inherited? This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition."

        {
            "question": "How to diagnose Hypokalemic periodic paralysis ?",
            "answer": "How is hypokalemic periodic paralysis diagnosed? The diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis is based on a history of episodes of paralysis and low levels of potassium in the blood during attacks (less than 0.9 to 3.0 mmol/L), but not between attacks. An important part of the diagnosis is to rule out other potential causes, including myotonia, hyperthyroidism, and arrhythmia. Affected individuals typically have a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Genetic testing is available for hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Of all individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for this condition, approximately 55 to 70 percent have mutations in the CACNA1S gene, and approximately 8 to 10 percent have mutations in the SCN4A gene. GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that perform clinical genetic testing of the CACNA1S and SCN4A genes for hypokalemic periodic paralysis. When a disease-causing mutation is identified in an affected individual, genetic testing can be performed for at-risk, asymptomatic family members. Please note:  Most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or a genetics professional.

            "question": "What is (are) Primary lateral sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "Primary lateral sclerosis is a type of motor neuron disease, where nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement breakdown and die. In primary lateral sclerosis only the upper motor neurons in the brain are affected. Symptoms often begin with problems in the legs (e.g., weakness, stiffness, spasticity, and balance problems), but may also start with hand clumsiness and changes in speech. The symptoms worsen gradually over time, however people with this condition have a normal life expectancy. Progression of symptoms varies from person to person, some people retain the ability to walk without assistance, others eventually require assistive devices such as canes or wheelchairs. Diagnosis requires extensive testing to exclude other diseases. Treatment may include baclofen and tizanidine to reduce spasticity, quinine or phenytoin to reduce cramps, as well as physical and speech therapy as required."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Primary lateral sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Primary lateral sclerosis? Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) causes weakness in the voluntary muscles, such as those used to control the legs, arms and tongue. PLS can happen at any age, but it is more common after age 40. A subtype of PLS, known as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, begins in early childhood. PLS is often mistaken for another, more common motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, primary lateral sclerosis progresses more slowly than ALS, and in most cases is not considered fatal. Signs and symptoms of PLS typically take years to progress. The hallmark of PLS is progressive weakness and spasticity of voluntary muscles. The first symptoms are often tripping or difficulty lifting the legs. Other people may be the first to notice a change in the affected person's gait. Occasionally, speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphasia) difficulties, or arm weakness are the first symptoms. Speech problems can begin with hoarseness, a reduced rate of speaking, excessive clearing of the throat, or slurred speech when a person is tired. In some cases, speech becomes so slurred that others cannot understand it. Drooling can be a problem as well due to weakened bulbar muscles. Many people report painful muscle spasms and other pain. Other common symptoms may include hyperactive reflexes and Babinkski's sign. Wherever symptoms originate, the legs, arms, hands, and speech and swallowing muscles are eventually affected. As the disease progresses, assistive devices such as canes, walkers or wheelchairs are typically needed.

            "question": "How to diagnose Primary lateral sclerosis ?",
            "answer": "How is primary lateral sclerosis diagnosed? There is no single test that confirms a diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Because the disease can mimic signs and symptoms of other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), several tests are done to rule out other diseases. After taking a careful record of an individual's medical history and performing a complete neurological examination, a doctor may order the following tests: Blood work. Blood tests are done to check for infections or other possible causes of muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine. An MRI or other imaging tests may reveal signs of nerve cell degeneration and look for other causes of symptoms, such as structural abnormalities, spinal cord compression, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord tumors. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. These tests use a low amount of electrical current to test how quickly the nerves carry impulses through the body, and can indicate damage to nerve cells. Electromyogram (EMG). During this test, the doctor inserts a needle electrode through the skin into various muscles. The electrical activity of the muscles is evaluated when they contract and when they're at rest. This test can measure the involvement of lower motor neurons, which can help to differentiate between PLS and ALS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. An analysis of the CSF, which is taken during a lumbar puncture in the lower back, can help to rule out multiple sclerosis and other causes of spasticity. After other diseases are ruled out, a doctor may make a preliminary diagnosis of PLS. Sometimes doctors wait three to four years before being sure of the diagnosis, because early ALS can look just like PLS until additional symptoms surface a few years later."

However, the condition can rarely affect more than one family member and be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In these cases, an affected person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

Attacks associated with VKC are common in the spring (hence the name \"vernal\") and summer but often reoccur in the winter. Signs and symptoms usually begin before 10 years of age and may include hard, cobblestone-like bumps (papillae) on the upper eyelid; sensitivity to light; redness; sticky mucus discharge; and involuntary blinking or spasms of the eyelid (blepharospasm). The condition usually subsides at the onset of puberty. It is caused by a hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to airborne-allergens. Management focuses on preventing \"flare ups\" and relieving the symptoms of the condition."

            "answer": "How might vernal keratoconjunctivitis be treated? Management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) focuses on preventing allergic attacks as well as relieving the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is often recommended that affected individuals try to avoid the agent that causes the allergy (if possible); wear dark sunglasses in the daytime; avoid dust; and stay inside on hot afternoons. Eye drops that affect the amount of histamine released by immune system cells (called mast cell stabilizers) may be used at the beginning of the season or at the first sign of a \"flare-up\" to prevent severe symptoms; however, they are not considered effective at relieving symptoms. Topical eye drops are generally preferred as the first source of treatment. Cold compresses, artificial tears, ointments and/or topical antihistamines may help. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may relieve symptoms in moderate cases; topical steroids are typically only used for more severe cases because long-term use can cause glaucoma. A few prescription drugs may also be available for the treatment of VKC; these include cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide tromethamine and Levocabastine. Oral administration of montelukast, a drug usually prescribed for asthma, has also been shown to be an effective treatment of VKC. For more information about these drugs and their availability, individuals should speak with their health care providers."

New variant CJD accounts for less than 1% of cases, and tends to affect younger people. It can result when someone is exposed to contaminated products. While classic CJD is not related to mad cow disease, new variant CJD (nvCJD) is an infectious form that is related to mad cow disease. The infection responsible for the disease in cows (bovine spongiform encephalitis) is believed to be the same one responsible for vCJD in humans. There have not been any cases of nvCJD reported in the U.S. Another variant, called the panencephalopathic form, occurs primarily in Japan and has a relatively long course, with symptoms often progressing for several years.

In general, Alzheimer disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgement and the ability to function socially. The exact underlying cause of late-onset familial AD is not completely understood; however, researchers suspect that it is a complex condition, which is likely associated with multiple susceptibility genes (such as the APOE e4 allele) in combination with environmental and lifestyle factors. Although complex conditions do tend to cluster in families, they do not follow a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. There is no cure for AD. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."

There are two main types of thalassemia, alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. Signs and symptoms vary but may include mild to severe anemia, paleness, fatigue, yellow discoloration of skin (jaundice), and bone problems. Beta thalassemia is caused by changes (mutations) in the HBB gene while alpha thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes. Both are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

There are two main types of thalassemia, alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia, which each affect a different part of hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen). Hemoglobin is made up of two different components (subunits): beta globin and alpha globin. The HBB gene provides instructions for making beta globin, while the HBA1 and HBA2 genes provide instructions for making alpha globin. Each person has two copies of each of these genes, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. Changes (mutations) in the HBB gene lead to reduced levels of beta globin and cause beta thalassemia. Loss (deletion) of some or all of the HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes results in a shortage of alpha globin, leading to alpha thalassemia."

            "question": "Is Thalassemia inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is thalassemia inherited? In general, thalassemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, the inheritance can be quite complex as multiple genes can influence the production of hemoglobin. Most people affected by beta thalassemia have mutations in both copies of the HBB gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition; although some carriers of beta thalassemia develop mild anemia. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. The inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complicated by the fact that mutations in two different genes (HBA1 and HBA2) are associated with the condition. People have two copies of the HBA1 gene and two copies of the HBA2 gene in each cell. For each gene, one copy is inherited from the mother and one is inherited from the father. If each parent is missing at least one gene copy, their children are at risk for having alpha thalassemia. However, the exact risk and the severity of each child's condition depends on how many gene copies are lost (deleted) and which combination of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes are affected."

Most affected individuals experience stroke-like episodes beginning before age 40. People with MELAS can also have a buildup of lactic acid in their bodies that can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. The genes associated with MELAS are located in mitochondrial DNA and therefore follow a maternal inheritance pattern (also called mitochondrial inheritance).

These episodes may involve temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body, altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated stroke-like episodes can progressively damage the brain, leading to vision loss, problems with movement, and a loss of intellectual function. Many people with MELAS have a buildup of lactic acid in their bodies (lactic acidosis). This can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing.

MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is therefore transmitted by maternal inheritance (also called mitochondrial inheritance). This type of inheritance applies to all conditions caused by genes in mtDNA. Mitochondria are structures in each cell that turn molecules into energy, and each contain a small amount of DNA. Only egg cells (not sperm cells) contribute mitochondria to offspring, so only females can pass on mitochondrial mutations to their children. Conditions resulting from mutations in mtDNA can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the condition results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in an individual with no history of MELAS in the family."

Genetic testing for a particular condition is typically available from only a few clinical laboratories because these conditions are rare and the tests are ordered infrequently. It is not uncommon to send DNA samples to a laboratory in another state, or even to laboratories in Canada or Europe. Genetic tests are more complicated than standard blood tests and are usually much more expensive. Due to the high cost of these tests, insurance companies may or may not provide coverage. Doctors sometimes write a letter of medical necessity to the insurance company stating why a particular test is needed, which sometimes pursuades the insurance company to cover the test. These letters state the medical benefits that a person would receive from a test, and how the test would alter a person's medical care. GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that perform genetic testing. This resource lists the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting genetic testing for MELAS. Another option is to participate in a research study that is performing genetic testing. While the cost of testing is often covered by the research funding, the tests may be more experimental and less accurate. In addition, results may not be reported to participants, or it may take a much longer time to receive any results.

Other, less common, treatments include oral pentoxifylline, medication that supresses the immune system (such as cyclosporine), radiotherapy, and a combination of all trans-retinoic acid and prednisone. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any medication."

            "question": "What is (are) Wilson disease ?",
            "answer": "Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. Because high levels of copper are toxic to tissues and organs, this buildup can lead to damage of the liver, brain and eyes. Signs and symptoms of Wilson disease include chronic liver disease, central nervous system abnormalities, and psychiatric (mental health-related) disturbances. It is caused by a mutation of the ATP7B gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although there is no cure for Wilson disease, therapies exist that aim to reduce or control the amount of copper that accumulates in the body."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Wilson disease ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Wilson disease? Wilson disease can affect many different systems of the body. Affected people often develop signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease in their teenaged years or early twenties. These features may include jaundice; abnormal fluid retention which can lead to swelling of the legs and/or abdomen; weight loss; nausea and vomiting; and/or fatigue. Unfortunately, some people may not experience any signs until they suddenly develop acute liver failure. Affected people often experience a variety of neurologic (central nervous system-related) signs and symptoms, as well. Neurologic features often develop after the liver has retained a significant amount of copper; however, they have been seen in people with little to no liver damage. These symptoms may include tremors; muscle stiffness; and problems with speech, swallowing and/or physical coordination. Almost all people with neurologic symptoms have Kayser-Fleisher rings - a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye that can best be viewed using an ophthalmologist's slit lamp. About a third of those with Wilson disease will also experience psychiatric (mental health-related) symptoms such as abrupt personality changes, depression accompanied by suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and/or psychosis. Other signs and symptoms may include: Menstrual period irregularities, increased risk of miscarriage and infertility in women Anemia Easy bruising and prolonged bleeding Kidney stones Early-onset arthritis Osteoporosis The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Wilson disease.

            "question": "What causes Wilson disease ?",
            "answer": "What causes Wilson disease? Wilson disease is caused by changes (mutations) in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in the transport of copper from the liver to the rest of the body. It also helps remove excess copper from the body. Mutations in the ATP7B gene prevent this protein from working properly, which can lead to an accumulation of copper in the body. Because high levels of copper are toxic, this buildup can damage tissues and organs and cause the many signs and symptoms of Wilson disease."

            "answer": "Is Wilson disease inherited? Wilson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."

Affected girls appear to have normal psychomotor development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental \"plateau,\" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. Additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea; gait ataxia and apraxia; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. Some people have an atypical form of Rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. Classic Rett syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and is usually inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new mutation in the affected person. Treatment mainly focuses on the specific signs and symptoms of the condition."

This gene provides instructions for making a protein (MeCP2) needed for the development of the nervous system and normal brain function. Mutations in the MECP2 gene that cause Rett syndrome can change the MeCP2 protein or result in the production of too little protein, which appears to disrupt the normal function of neurons and other cells in the brain. Several conditions caused by changes in other genes (such as FOXG1 syndrome) have overlapping signs and/or symptoms of Rett syndrome. These conditions were once thought to be variant forms of Rett syndrome, but are now usually considered to be separate disorders."

            "answer": "Is Rett syndrome inherited? Although Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder, less than 1 percent of recorded cases are inherited or passed from one generation to the next. Most cases are sporadic, which means the mutation occurs randomly, and are not inherited. A few families have been described with more than one affected family member. These cases helped researchers determine that Rett syndrome has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition."

            "question": "What causes Klinefelter syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Klinefelter syndrome? Klinefelter syndrome usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or more extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. Most often, Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a single extra copy of the X chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Males normally have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (46, XY), while females have two X chromosomes (46, XX). People with Klinefelter syndrome usually have two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47, XXY). Some people with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; these people are said to have mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. It is estimated that about half of the time, the cell division error occurs during development of the sperm, while the remainder are due to errors in egg development. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 have a slightly increased chance of having offspring with this syndrome. The features of Klinefelter syndrome are due to the extra copies of genes on the extra X chromosome, which can alter male sexual development."

When a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This may include: Educational interventions - As children, many people with Klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. Therapeutic options - A variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. Medical management - About half of people with KS have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair. Many healthcare providers recommend testosterone therapy when a boy reaches puberty. However, not all males with KS benefit from testosterone therapy. Some affected people may opt to have breast removal or reduction surgery.

The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour. Researchers have identified three forms of familial hemiplegic migraine known as FHM1, FHM2, and FHM3.

            "question": "What causes Myotonic dystrophy ?",
            "answer": "What causes myotonic dystrophy? Myotonic dystrophy is caused by mutations called nucleotide repeat expansions in either the DMPK gene (in type 1) or the CNBP gene (in type 2). Nucleotide repeat expansions occur when a piece of DNA is abnormally repeated a number of times, which makes the gene unstable. In myotonic dystrophy, the gene instability leads to a series of events that ultimately prevent cells in muscles and other tissues from acting normally, leading to the features of the condition. The exact functions of these genes in not well understood. The DMPK gene may play a role in communication within cells, specifically in cells of the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. The CNBP gene gives directions to make a protein found mainly in cells of the heart and skeletal muscles, where it is thought to regulate the activities of other genes."

            "answer": "What treatment is available for for myotonic dystrophy? There is currently no cure or specific treatment for myotonic dystrophy. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and minimizing disability. Routine physical activity appears to help maintain muscle strength and endurance and to control musculoskeletal pain. Canes, braces, walkers and scooters can help as muscle weakness progresses. There are also medications that can lessen the myotonia. Pain management can be achieved through the use of mexilitene, gabapentin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), low-dose thyroid replacement, low-dose steroids (prednisone), and tricyclic antidepressants. Other symptoms of myotonic dystrophy can also be treated. Heart problems should be followed by a cardiologist, but may be managed through insertion of a pacemaker and regular monitoring of cardiac function. Cataracts can be surgically corrected."

            "question": "Is Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius inherited? Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes in each cell and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in each cell. Although females have two X chromosomes, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is \"turned off\" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. Females who have a change (mutation) in a gene on one of their X chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. Carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because the X chromosome with the mutated gene is often turned off and they have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. Sometimes, the X chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. However, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. A male has only one X chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the X chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected). Males with an X-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers. A male cannot pass an X-linked gene to his sons because males always pass their Y chromosome to male offspring. Female carriers of an X-linked recessive condition have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter like themselves, a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have an affected son, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. This also means that each daughter of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of being a carrier, and each son has a 50% chance of having the condition."

The term itself is derived from the Greek \"kamptos\" (to bend) and \"kormos\" (trunk) BSS was initially considered, especially in wartime, as a result of a psychogenic disorder. It is now recognized that in it may also be related to a number of musculo-skeletal or neurological disorders. It seems that myopathy is the primary cause of camptocormia based on electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (CT/MRI scans) of paraspinal muscles, and muscle biopsy. The majority of BSS of muscular origin is related to a primary idiopathic (with unknwon cause) axial myopathy of late onset, maybe a delayed-onset paraspinal myopathy, appearing in elderly patients. Causes of secondary BSS are numerous. The main causes are muscular disorders like inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophies of late onset, myotonic myopathies, endocrine and metabolic myopathies, and neurological disorders, principally Parkinsons disease. Diagnosis of axial myopathy is based upon CT/MRI scans demonstrating a lot of fatty infiltration of paravertebral muscles. General activity, walking with a cane, physiotherapy, and exercises should be encouraged. Treatment of secondary forms of BSS is dependent upon the cause."

            "question": "What is (are) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ?",
            "answer": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare fatal brain disorder that usually occurs later in life and runs a rapid course. In the early stages of the disease, patients may have failing memory, behavior changes, impaired coordination, and vision problems. As CJD progresses, mental deterioration becomes severe, and they can have uncontrolled movements, blindness, weakness, and go into a coma. This condition often leads to death within a few weeks or months after symptoms begin. About 90 percent of patients do not survive for more than one year. In the United States, about 300 people are diagnosed with this condition each year. It occurs in approximately one in every one million people worldwide. CJD can be very difficult to diagnose because it is similar to other forms of dementia. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is to test a small sample of brain tissue, which can be done by brain biopsy or autopsy. CJD is caused by the build up of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. For most patients, the reason for the abnormal prions is unknown (sporadic CJD). About 5 to 10 percent of cases are due to an inherited genetic mutation associated with CJD (familial CJD). This condition can also be acquired through contact with infected brain tissue (iatrogenic CJD) or consuming infected beef (variant CJD). There is no specific treatment for CJD, so the goal is to make a person as comfortable as possible."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia. Initially, patients experience problems with muscular coordination; personality changes, including impaired memory, judgment, and thinking; and impaired vision. People with the disease also may experience insomnia, depression, or unusual sensations. CJD does not cause a fever or other flu-like symptoms. As the illness progresses, the patients mental impairment becomes severe. They often develop involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus, and they may go blind. They eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma. Pneumonia and other infections often occur in these patients and can lead to death. There are several known variants of CJD. These variants differ somewhat in the symptoms and course of the disease. For example, a variant form of the disease-called new variant or variant (nv-CJD, v-CJD), described in Great Britain and France-begins primarily with psychiatric symptoms, affects younger patients than other types of CJD, and has a longer than usual duration from onset of symptoms to death. Another variant, called the panencephalopathic form, occurs primarily in Japan and has a relatively long course, with symptoms often progressing for several years. Scientists are trying to learn what causes these variations in the symptoms and course of the disease.

            "question": "What causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ?",
            "answer": "What causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? Some researchers believe an unusual 'slow virus' or another organism causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, they have never been able to isolate a virus or other organism in people with the disease. Furthermore, the agent that causes CJD has several characteristics that are unusual for known organisms such as viruses and bacteria. It is difficult to kill, it does not appear to contain any genetic information in the form of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), and it usually has a long incubation period before symptoms appear. In some cases, the incubation period may be as long as 40 years. The leading scientific theory at this time maintains that CJD and the other TSEs are caused by a type of protein called a prion. Prion proteins occur in both a normal form, which is a harmless protein found in the bodys cells, and in an infectious form, which causes disease. The harmless and infectious forms of the prion protein have the same sequence of amino acids (the 'building blocks' of proteins) but the infectious form of the protein takes a different folded shape than the normal protein. Sporadic CJD may develop because some of a persons normal prions spontaneously change into the infectious form of the protein and then alter the prions in other cells in a chain reaction. Once they appear, abnormal prion proteins aggregate, or clump together. Investigators think these protein aggregates may lead to the neuron loss and other brain damage seen in CJD. However, they do not know exactly how this damage occurs. About 5 to 10 percent of all CJD cases are inherited. These cases arise from a mutation, or change, in the gene that controls formation of the normal prion protein. While prions themselves do not contain genetic information and do not require genes to reproduce themselves, infectious prions can arise if a mutation occurs in the gene for the bodys normal prion protein. If the prion protein gene is altered in a persons sperm or egg cells, the mutation can be transmitted to the persons offspring. Several different mutations in the prion gene have been identified. The particular mutation found in each family affects how frequently the disease appears and what symptoms are most noticeable. However, not all people with mutations in the prion protein gene develop CJD."

            "question": "How to diagnose Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ?",
            "answer": "How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosed? There is currently no single diagnostic test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). When a doctor suspects CJD, the first concern is to rule out treatable forms of dementia such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or chronic meningitis. A neurological examination will be performed and the doctor may seek consultation with other physicians. Standard diagnostic tests will include a spinal tap to rule out more common causes of dementia and an electroencephalogram (EEG) to record the brains electrical pattern, which can be particularly valuable because it shows a specific type of abnormality in CJD. Computerized tomography of the brain can help rule out the possibility that the symptoms result from other problems such as stroke or a brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans also can reveal characteristic patterns of brain degeneration that can help diagnose CJD. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of CJD is by brain biopsy or autopsy. In a brain biopsy, a neurosurgeon removes a small piece of tissue from the patients brain so that it can be examined by a neuropathologist. This procedure may be dangerous for the patient, and the operation does not always obtain tissue from the affected part of the brain. Because a correct diagnosis of CJD does not help the patient, a brain biopsy is discouraged unless it is needed to rule out a treatable disorder. In an autopsy, the whole brain is examined after death. Scientists are working to develop laboratory tests for CJD. One such test, developed at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies a person's cerebrospinal fluid to see of it contains a protein marker that indicates neuronal degeneration.This can help to diagnose CJD in people who already show the clinical symptoms of the disease. This test is much easier and safer than a brain biopsy. The false positive rate is about 5 to 10 percent. Scientists are working to develop this test for use in commercial laboratories. They are also working to develop other tests for this disorder."

Researchers have tested many drugs, including amantadine, steroids, interferon, acyclovir, antiviral agents, and antibiotics. Studies of a variety of other drugs are now in progress. However, so far none of these treatments has shown any consistent benefit in humans. Current treatment for CJD is aimed at alleviating symptoms and making the patient as comfortable as possible. Opiate drugs can help relieve pain if it occurs, and the drugs clonazepam and sodium valproate may help relieve myoclonus. During later stages of the disease, changing the persons position frequently can keep him or her comfortable and helps prevent bedsores. A catheter can be used to drain urine if the patient cannot control bladder function, and intravenous fluids and artificial feeding also may be used."

Increased production of IL-6 may result in an overgrowth of lymphatic cells, leading to many of the signs and symptoms of CD. It has also been found that a virus called human herpes virus type 8 (also known as HHV-8, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, or KSHV) is present in many people with multicentric CD, specifically. HHV-8 is found in nearly all people who are HIV-positive and develop multicentric CD, and in up to 60% of affected people without HIV.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy ?",
            "answer": "How might Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) be treated? There is currently no cure for Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) and treatment options are limited. Management of hereditary retinal dystrophies generally focuses on vision rehabilitation, which involves the use of low vision aids, orientation, and mobility training. The goal of visual rehabilitation is to reach maximum function, a sense of well being, a personally satisfying level of independence, and optimum quality of life. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, can develop in people with DHRD and has a poor visual prognosis. The authors of a 2011 study reported that 2 people with DHRD and CNV were treated with a course of intravitreal bevacizumab (injected into the eye). This treatment stopped fluid leakage and led to increased visual acuity. They proposed that recovery of visual acuity after treatment of CNV in these cases shows that the loss of retinal function may be reversible. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in more studies with a larger number of participants. There was also a case report of a person with malattia leventinese (a condition very similar to DHRD and sometimes considered the same) who was treated successfully with photodynamic therapy using verteporfin. The treatment reportedly prevented severe visual loss in the patient. The authors of this case report proposed that photodynamic therapy be considered as a possible treatment in patients with malattia leventinese or DHRD who develop CNV.   You may consider participating in a clinical trial for treatment of retinal dystrophy. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developed ClinicalTrials.gov to provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.  There are many clinical trials currently enrolling individuals with hereditary retinal dystrophy. View a list of these studies here. After you click on a study, review its eligibility criteria to determine its appropriateness. We suggest reviewing the list of studies with your physician.

            "answer": "Takayasu arteritis is a condition that causes inflammation of the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (aorta) and its associated branched blood vessels. As a result of the inflammation, the blood vessel walls become thick and make it difficult for blood to flow. Over time, impaired blood flow causes damage to the heart and various other organs of the body.  Although the cause remains unknown, Takayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition, in which cells that fight infection and disease are wrongly targeted against the body's own tissues."

This syndrome also includes failure to thrive in the newborn, microcephaly, and impaired nervous system development. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, tooth decay, and eye and bone abnormalities.  Cockayne syndrome type 1 (type A) is sometimes called classic or \"moderate\" Cockayne syndrome and is diagnosed during early childhood. Cockayne syndrome type 2 (type B) is sometimes referred to as the severe or \"early-onset\" type. This more severe form presents with growth and developmental abnormalities at birth. The third type, Cockayne syndrome type 3 (type C) is a milder form of the disorder. Cockayne syndrome is caused by mutations in either the ERCC8 (CSA) or ERCC6 (CSB) genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The typical lifespan for individuals with Cockayne syndrome type 1 is ten to twenty years. Individuals with type 2 usually do not survive past childhood.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis? There are three general types of GM1 gangliosidosis, which differ in severity but can have considerable overlap of signs and symptoms. Classic infantile (type 1) GM1 gangliosidosis is the most severe type, with onset shortly after birth (usually within 6 months of age). Affected infants typically appear normal until onset, but developmental regression (loss of acquired milestones) eventually occurs. Signs and symptoms may include neurodegeneration, seizures, liver and spleen enlargement, coarsening of facial features, skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness, a distended abdomen, muscle weakness, an exaggerated startle response to sound, and problems with gait (manner of walking). About half of people with this type develop cherry-red spots in the eye. Children may become deaf and blind by one year of age. Affected children typically do not live past 2 years of age. Juvenile (type 2) GM1 gangliosidosis is considered an intermediate form of the condition and may begin between the ages of 1 and 5. Features include ataxia, seizures, dementia, and difficulties with speech. This type progresses more slowly than type 1, but still causes decreased life expectancy (around mid-childhood or early adulthood). Adult (type 3) GM1 gangliosidosis may cause signs and symptoms to develop anywhere between the ages of 3 and 30. Affected people may have muscle atrophy, corneal clouding and dystonia. Non-cancerous skin blemishes may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body. Adult GM1 is usually less severe and progresses more slowly than other forms of the condition.

            "question": "What causes GM1 gangliosidosis ?",
            "answer": "What causes GM1 gangliosidosis? All three types of GM1 gangliosidosis are caused by mutations (changes) in the GLB1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (-galactosidase), which plays an important role in the brain. The enzyme resides in compartments within cells called lysosomes, where it helps break down certain molecules, including a substance called GM1 ganglioside. GM1 ganglioside is important for nerve cell function in the brain. Mutations in the GLB1 gene may lower or eliminate the activity of the -galactosidase enzyme, keeping GM1 ganglioside from being broken down. As a result, it accumulates to toxic levels in tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. This accumulation leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing the features of the condition. In general, people with higher enzyme activity levels usually have milder features than those with lower activity levels."

            "question": "Is GM1 gangliosidosis inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is GM1 gangliosidosis inherited? GM1 gangliosidosis is a hereditary condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has: a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier GM1 gangliosidosis is type-specific within families. This means that people with a family history of the condition are generally only at increased risk for the specific type of GM1 gangliosidosis in the family."

            "question": "How to diagnose GM1 gangliosidosis ?",
            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for GM1 gangliosidosis? Yes. A diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis (GM1), can be made by either enzyme analysis of the beta-galactosidase enzyme, or by molecular genetic testing of the GLB1 gene. Despite the availability of molecular genetic testing, the mainstay of diagnosis will likely continue to be enzyme activity because of cost and difficulty in interpreting unclear results. However, enzyme activity may not be predictive of carrier status in relatives of affected people. Carrier testing for at-risk family members is done with molecular genetic testing, and is possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are already known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the labs that offer genetic testing for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Therefore, patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."

Symptomatic treatment for some of the neurologic signs and symptoms is available, but does not significantly alter the progression of the condition. For example, anticonvulsants may initially control seizures. Supportive treatments may include proper nutrition and hydration, and keeping the affected individual's airway open. Bone marrow transplantation was reportedly successful in an individual with infantile/juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis; however, no long-term benefit was reported. Presymptomatic cord-blood hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been advocated by some as a possible treatment due to its success in other lysosomal storage disorders. Active research in the areas of enzyme replacement and gene therapy for the condition is ongoing but has not yet advanced to human trials. Neurologic and orthopedic sequelae may prevent adequate physical activity, but affected individuals may benefit from physical and occupational therapy."

            "question": "What causes Turner syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Turner syndrome? Turner syndrome is caused by partial or complete loss of one of the X chromosomes in cells of females. Females without Turner syndrome have 2 full X chromosome in all of their cells (and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome). The missing genetic material affects development before and after birth. Most females with Turner syndrome are missing a full X chromosome in all of their cells (also called monosomy X). This form results from a random error in an egg or sperm cell prior to conception. Some females with Turner syndrome have two X chromosomes, but one of them is missing a piece (has a deletion). Depending on the specific gene(s) that are missing, the features of Turner syndrome may result. A deletion may occur sporadically (not inherited) or may be inherited from a parent. Mosaic Turner syndrome (when some cells have one X chromosome and some have two sex chromosomes) is caused by a random error in early fetal development (shortly after conception). It is still unclear exactly which genes on the X chromosome are associated with each feature of Turner syndrome. It is known that the SHOX gene on the X chromosome is important for growth and bone development. A missing copy of this gene is thought to result in the short stature and skeletal abnormalities in many affected women."

            "question": "Is Turner syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is Turner syndrome inherited? Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. Most commonly, Turner syndrome occurs due to a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (prior to conception). For example, if an egg or sperm cell mistakenly loses a sex chromosome, and joins at conception with an egg or sperm containing an X chromosome, the resulting child will have a single X chromosome in each cell. Mosaic Turner syndrome, occurring when a person has some cells with one X chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes, is also not inherited. This also occurs due to a random event, during early fetal development rather than before conception. In rare cases, Turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the X chromosome. A deletion can be inherited from a parent. Genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of Turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence. People with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for Turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional."

            "answer": "What causes brittle diabetes? There are multiple causes of brittle diabetes. Emotional stress seems to play an important role, in some cases leading to hormonal inbalances which can lead to brittle diabetes. Emotional stress can also lead to a shift in the behavior of an individual, leading them to neglect their self-care. Other cases can be traced to physiological causes, including malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying due to autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis), celiac disease, impaired glucose counterregulation (which doesn't allow the patient's body to react as it should when blood glucose levels drop), hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, drug or alcohol use, systemic insulin resistance, and abnormal insulin absorption or degradation."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Brittle diabetes ?",
            "answer": "How might brittle diabetes be treated? The approach to management depends upon the underlying cause. General management strategies include diabetes education, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, the use of a continuous subcutaneous insulin pump in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring device, and, in rare cases, pancreas transplantation. Psychotherapy or working with a psychiatrist or psychologist is recommended for many people with brittle diabetes. Referral to a specialty center may be warranted in certain situations."

            "question": "What causes Schnitzler syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Schnitzler syndrome? The exact underlying cause of Schnitzler syndrome is currently unknown. People affected by this condition often have a blood abnormality called monoclonal gammopathy, a condition in which the body over-produces certain immunoglobulins (typically immunoglobulin M). Immunoglobulins are proteins that are made by certain white blood cells. They play a role in the immune response by helping destroy bacteria, viruses, and other substances that appear foreign and harmful. Some researchers believe that the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulins in the skin and other parts of the body may play a role in the development of the signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome. Other scientists speculate that alterations in cytokines may play a role in the development of Schnitzler syndrome. Cytokines are specialized proteins that play an important role in the immune response. They are secreted by certain immune system cells and play a vital role in controlling the growth and activity of other immune system cells. Abnormal findings involving a specific cytokine called interleukin-1 have been found in some people with Schnitzler syndrome."

Additional eye abnormalities are also often present, including a very small cornea and nystagmus. In some cases, the condition may also be associated with physical abnormalities and/or intellectual disability. The range and severity of symptoms may vary greatly from one person to another, even among affected members of the same family. Nance-Horan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the NHS gene and is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait, which means that both males and females can be affected, but males often have more severe symptoms.The treatment is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in the individual."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Nance-Horan syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Nance-Horan syndrome? The main features of Nance-Horan syndrome include congenital cataracts, dental abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and in some cases, intellectual disability. In affected males, the primary physical characteristic is the presence of dense clouding of the lens (cornea) of both eyes at birth (congenital bilateral cataracts). The cataracts usually result in blurred vision and severely decreased clearness or clarity of vision (visual acuity). Vision loss can potentially be profound. Males with Nance-Horan syndrome may have additional eye abnormalities, including a very small cornea (microcornea); involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and/or misalignment of the eyes (strabismus). In some cases, the entire eye may be abnormally small (microphthalmia) and/or the upper eyelid may droop (ptosis). Males with Nance-Horan syndrome may also have several dental abnormalities such as unusually shaped, extra (supernumerary) teeth, absence of some teeth (dental agenesis), impacted teeth or unusually wide spaces (diastema) between some of the teeth. The front teeth, or incisors, are usually tapered and 'screwdriver-shaped'. The teeth in the back of the mouth may be cone-shaped, rounded, or cylindrical. In many males with Nance-Horan syndrome, other physical findings may also occur. Distinctive facial features may be present, but may be subtle. The ears may be flared forward and unusually prominent. Affected males may also have a large, prominent nose with a high, narrow nasal bridge, a narrow prominent jaw, and sometimes a long, narrow face. Some males with Nance-Horan syndrome may also experience delays the skills necessary for coordinating muscular and mental activity. In addition, some reports suggest that approximately 20 to 30 percent of affected males may have varying levels of intellectual disability, which is usually mild to moderate; but in some cases can be severe. Females who carry a single copy of the mutation in the NHS gene may develop some symptoms of the disorder. However, symptoms are usually milder and more variable than those seen in males. Affected females may have abnormally small corneas (microcornea) and/or some clouding of the cornea. Vision may be normal, or there may be slightly decreased visual acuity. Without appropriate treatment, clouding of the cornea can lead to total cataracts later in life. Females often have some dental abnormalities, such as abnormally-shaped front teeth and/or unusually wide spaces between some of the teeth. Affected females usually do not develop intellectual disability. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nance-Horan syndrome.

            "answer": "How is Nance-Horan syndrome inherited? Nance-Horan syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait. In X-linked dominant inheritance, both males and females can be affected by a condition. However, affected males tend to have more severe features than females. X-linked conditions result from mutations of a gene located on an X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, but males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In females, disease traits resulting from the abnormal copy of a gene on one X chromosome can be 'masked' by the normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome. Because only one functioning X chromosome is required in males and females, one of the X chromosomes in each cell of a female is essentially 'turned off,' usually in a random pattern (X chromosome inactivation). Therefore, if the X chromosome with the gene mutation is activated in some cells, female carriers may have some mild features of the disorder. However, since males only have one X chromosome, they will likely fully express a condition if they inherit a gene mutation that is located on the X chromosome."

When someone is first diagnosed with this condition, a physical examination is done to assess the extent and severity of muscle weakness, and physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments to determine which therapies might be most beneficial.  Physical therapy, such as stretching or low-impact exercises, may help improve weakness.  Some skeletal abnormalities can be addressed with physical therapy, though others may require surgery.  As the muscle weakness and scoliosis associated with CCD can affect breathing, individuals diagnosed with this condition may benefit from pulmonary function tests.  If breathing is significantly affected, breathing exercises or other breathing support treatments may be recommended.  Another treatment option may be a medication called salbutamol, which was found to significantly increased muscle strength and stamina in six of eight children with CCD."

            "answer": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), congenital is a blood disorder characterized by low platelets (i.e., thrombocytopenia), small areas of bleeding under the skin (i.e., purpura), low red blood cell count, and hemolytic anemia. TTP causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Resulting complications can include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Hemolytic anemia can lead to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. TTP, congenital is much rarer than the acquired form and typically appears in infancy or early childhood. Signs and symptoms often recur on a regular basis. TTP, congenital results from mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

Symptoms include mental status changes, loss of coordination, fever, muscular weakness or partial paralysis affecting one side of the body, double vision, sensitivity to light and other neurologic problems. The diagnosis is difficult and is often made at advanced stages. Tests useful in the diagnosis include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps and in disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites and testing by the laboratory experts. Early diagnosis is important for the prognosis. No single drug is effective; hence multiple antibiotics are needed for successful treatment. A combination of surgical and medical interventions involving multiple specialty experts is required to prevent death and morbidity in survivors."

            "question": "What is (are) MTHFR gene mutation ?",
            "answer": "MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that disrupts the production of an enzyme that plays an important role in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine (a building block of protein). These mutations may cause a mild to severe loss of activity of this enzyme that can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood and/or urine. Some rare MTHFR gene mutations severely impair the function of this enzyme and lead to homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by various health problems including abnormal clotting and neurological problems (developmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability and microcephaly). Common MTHFR gene mutations (such as C677T and A1298C) lead to a milder reduction in enzyme function. People with two copies of C677T or one copy of C677T and one copy of A1298C may have an increased risk for cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, blood clots, and stroke. Many people who inherit these mutations never develop one of the associated conditions."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of MTHFR gene mutation ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of MTHFR gene mutations? People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine. A few cases of severe homocysteinemia have been due to rare MTHFR gene mutations (sometimes in combination with a second common MTHFR gene mutation). Symptoms in these patients varied greatly but often involved pronounced neurological symptoms and blood vessel disease. The age of the patients when they first experienced symptoms varied from infancy to adulthood. Common MTHFR gene mutations cause less severe, although still significantly raised levels of homocysteine. The most well studied MTHFR mutation, is C677T. An estimated 11% of Americans carry two copies of this mutation. People with two copies of C677T have higher homocysteine levels, than those without the mutation (people with one copy of C677T may have mildly raised homocysteine levels).  Many studies have investigated the health effects of high homocysteine levels and/or having two C677T MTHFR gene mutations. Some studies suggest that an elevated level of homocysteine in the blood is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke. Specifically, studies have estimated that people with two C677T MTHFR mutations have a 16% higher chance of developing coronary heart disease, when compared to people without these mutations. Weaker associations have been suggested between high homocysteine levels and narrowing of the carotid arteries (the arteries on each side of your neck), blood clots in deep veins (often in the lower leg and thigh), a sudden blockage in a lung artery, and pregnancy complications (such as preeclampsia, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and neural tube defects). Studies involving MTHFR and homocysteine and the following conditions have been completed, but with conflicting and varied results:* Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Psoriasis Infertility Recurrent pregnancy loss Downs syndrome Spina bifida Parkinson disease Alzheimer disease Migraine Cerebral venous thrombosis Psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia Breast cancer Cervical cancer Ovarian cancer Esophageal cancer Oral cancer Liver cancer Pancreatic cancer Prostate cancer Bladder cancer Lung cancer Stomach cancer Colorectal cancer Acute lymphoblastic leukemia *This is not an exhaustive list of all studies involving MTHFR and health effects."

Because each person has two copies of the MTHFR gene, people can inherit one copy of the MTHFR mutation or two copies (one from each parent). People who inherit two copies of a common MTHFR gene mutation (for example two C677T mutations or a C677T mutation and a A1298C mutation) may have an increased risk for certain conditions such as coronary artery disease, blood clots, and stroke when compared to those without the mutations and elevated homocystine levels. Coronary artery disease, blood clots, and stroke are all complex conditions and are caused by a combination of many genetic and environmental factors.

The College of American Pathologists and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend against testing for C677T and A1298C in people with blood clots. This is because the relationship between C677T and A1298C mutations and risk for cardiovascular disease is not completely understood. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers.

            "answer": "How might a MTHFR gene mutation be treated? High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations, such as C677T and A1298C. Currently there are no treatments to remove adverse risks associated with MTHFR gene mutations. However, elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin). It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of naturally occurring folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate nutritional risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate (5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered. We recommend that you talk to your doctor to learn if supplementation would benefit you. Smoking cessation and, when possible, avoidance of medications that adversely affect homocystiene level are additional management strategies."

Many individuals with this condition develop high blood levels of a waste product called uric acid. Normally, the kidneys remove uric acid from the blood and transfer it to urine. In FJHN, the kidneys are unable to remove uric acid from the blood effectively. Beginning in the early teens, FJHN causes gout and slowly progressive kidney disease, resulting in kidney failure. People with FJHN typically require either dialysis to remove wastes from the blood or a kidney transplant.

            "answer": "Adenylosuccinase deficiency is a rare, inherited metabolic condition that results from a lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase. Signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. In general, affected individuals may have a mix of neurological symptoms, which usually includes abnormalities with cognition and movement, autistic features, epilepsy, muscle wasting, and feeding problems. Although less common, abnormal physical features can include severe growth failure, small head, abnormally shaped head, strabismus, small nose with upturned nostrils, thin upper lip, and low set ears. Adenylosuccinase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ADSL gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."

Seizures are observed in 60 percent of affected individuals. Seizures may begin within the first month of life and, in many cases, are the first sign of the condition. Some of the neurological symptoms include floppiness (hypotonia) with severe tension of the hands and feet (hypertonia); muscle wasting; muscle twitchings of the tongue or hands and feet; and crossed eyes (strabismus). Almost all affected individuals experience delayed motor milestones ranging from mild to severe. In the first years of life, growth delay has been observed in 30 percent of affected individuals, mainly related to feeding problems. Autism has been found to be present in one-third of cases. Some children display unusual behavior such as stereotyped behavior, (hand washing movements, repetitive manipulation of toys, grimacing, clapping hands, rubbing feet, and inappropriate laughter), aggressive behavior, temper tantrums, impulsivity, hyperactivity, short attention span, and hypersensitivity to noise and lights.

The affected veins are initially red and tender and subsequently become a painless, tough, fibrous band that is accompanied by tension and retraction of the nearby skin. In most cases, the condition is benign and resolves on its own; however, Mondor disease can rarely be associated with breast cancer. Although the condition most commonly affects the chest, Mondor disease of other body parts (including the penis, groin, and abdomen) has been described, as well. Mondor disease is thought to occur when pressure or trauma on the veins causes blood to stagnate. In most cases, the condition arises after recent breast surgery, but it can also be associated with physical strain and/or tight-fitting clothing (i.e. bras). Treatments are available to help relieve symptoms until the condition resolves."

Lymphocytes are an important part of the immune system because they help fight off diseases and protect the body from infection. About 95% of adults are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Most infections occur during childhood and do not cause any symptoms. EBV infection in adolescents or young adults can often result in infectious mononucleosis.  Rarely, people infected with EBV develop a life-threatening condition called chronic active EBV virus (CAEBV). Patients with CAEBV most often have fever, liver dysfunction, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), and low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia).

            "question": "What is (are) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ?",
            "answer": "Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an eye disease. It affects the thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea. This layer is called the endothelium. The disease occurs when these cells slowly start to die off. The cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea. There are several forms of the disease according to the age of onset of the symptoms and the cause. The early-onset form is very rare and is known as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 1 (or early-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy) and it is caused by a change (mutation) in the COL8A2 gene. Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophies are common and include: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 2 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 13) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 3 (may be caused by TCF4 gene mutations) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 4 (caused by a mutation in the SLC4A11 gene) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 5 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 15) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 6 (caused by a mutation in the ZEB1 gene) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 7 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 9) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 8 (caused by heterozygous mutation in the AGBL1 gene).  Early in the disease, patients typically do not have symptoms. In the late-onset forms, the symptoms start around 50 or 60 years and include discomfort and painful episodes of recurrent corneal wounds and hazy vision. Over time, discomfort may diminish but severe impairment of visual acuity, and even blindness and cataracts in elderly patients, may be observed. Once the vision has worsened, the recommended treatment is a penetrating graft which has excellent results in most cases."

            "question": "Is Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy inherited? The inheritance of Fuchs dystrophy is not straight forward. In some cases, Fuchs dystrophy appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. When this condition is caused by a mutation in the COL8A2 gene (which is the early-onset form of the disease), it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In addition, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is seen in some situations in which the condition is caused by changes in an unknown gene. However, in many cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown. Some cases result from new mutations in a gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Due to the complex nature of the inheritance of this condition, we strongly recommend you discuss your concerns with a genetics professional."

As a result, homocystine, methylmalonic acid, and other harmful substances build-up in the body. Treatment should begin as soon as possible. In general, treatment may involve a low-protein diet, medical formula/drink, regular meals, careful monitoring, and vitamin B12 shots. Most US states now offer newborn screening for MMA+HCU, allowing for early detection and treatment. However even with early treatment, most children with MMA+HCU experience some symptoms affecting vision, growth, and learning. MMA+HCU cblC type is caused by changes in the MMACHC gene.

For both methylmalonic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria (MMA+HCU) cblC type signs and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. There have been cases of MMA+HCU cblC type associated with mild symptoms and delayed age at onset (teen to adult years). In most cases however, signs and symptoms of MMA+HCU cblC type present in infancy. Even with early diagnosis and treatment, children with the condition tend to have symptoms affecting vision, growth, and learning. A recent study of 12 children with early onset MMA+HCU CblC type, diagnosed by newborn screening, and treated early with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, oral betaine, folinic acid, l-carnitine, and dietary protein modification were reported to have developed the following symptoms: Mild to moderate low muscle tone (91%) Quick uncontrollable movements of the eye (nystagmus) with variable affect on vision (75%) Seizure (25%) Small head circumference (17%) Testing of communication, socialization, daily living skills, motor skills, and behavior showed mild to moderate delays in these areas for most children.

Additional common features of CDPX1 are shortened fingers and a flat nose. Some people with this condition have breathing abnormalities, hearing loss, abnormalities of the spinal bones in the neck, and delayed intellectual development. CDPX1 is caused by changes in the ARSE gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and occurs almost exclusively in males.

The most common internal site involved is the gastrointestinal tract (with almost half of affected people having colorectal cancer), followed by the genitourinary tract. Skin lesions may develop before or after the diagnosis of the internal cancer. MTS is caused by changes (mutations) in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A mutation in either of these genes gives a person an increased lifetime risk of developing the skin changes and types of cancer associated with the condition."

Other types of skin tumors in affected people include sebaceous epitheliomas, sebaceous carcinomas (which commonly occur on the eyelids) and keratoacanthomas. Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid can invade the orbit of the eye and frequently metastasize, leading to death. Tumors at other sites can also metastasize, but are less likely to cause death. Common sites of keratocathomas include the face and the upper side of the hands, but they can occur anywhere on the body. The most common internal cancer in people with MTS is colorectal cancer, occurring in almost half of affected people. The second most common site is the genitourinary tract. Other cancers that may occur include breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia (rarely), salivary gland tumors, lower and upper respiratory tract tumors, and chondrosarcoma.

            "question": "What causes Muir-Torre syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Muir-Torre syndrome? Muir-Torre syndrome is a subtype of Lynch syndrome and may be caused by changes (mutations) in either the MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 gene. These genes give the body instructions to make proteins needed for repairing DNA. The proteins help fix mistakes that are made when DNA is copied before cells divide. When one of these genes is mutated and causes the related protein to be absent or nonfunctional, the number of DNA mistakes that do not get repaired increases substantially. The affected cells do not function normally, increasing the risk of tumor formation. The MSH2 gene is responsible for MTS in the majority of cases. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 have the most severe effect. Not everyone diagnosed with MTS will have a detectable mutation in one of these genes. Other, unidentified genes may also play a role in the development of the condition."

            "question": "Is Muir-Torre syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Muir-Torre syndrome inherited? Muir-Torre-syndrome (MTS) is a variant of Lynch syndrome and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough for a person to develop the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the responsible gene. It is important to note that people who inherit a mutated gene that causes MTS inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit a mutation in an associated gene will develop cancer. This phenomenon is called reduced penetrance. The majority of people diagnosed with a form of Lynch syndrome have inherited the mutated gene from a parent. However, because not all people with a mutation develop cancer, and the variable age at which cancer may develop, not all people with a mutation have a parent who had cancer. Thus, the family history may appear negative. A positive family history of MTS is identified in roughly 50% of affected people. The percentage of people with Lynch syndrome who have a new mutation in the gene that occurred for the first time (and was not inherited from a parent) is unknown but is estimated to be extremely low."

A person diagnosed with MTS can also have genetic testing to see if they have a mutation in one of the genes known to cause MTS. However, not everyone with Muir-Torre syndrome will have a detectable mutation in one of these genes. Other, unidentified genes may also play a role in the development of the condition."

Other signs and symptoms may include an increase in the heart muscle size (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); excessive body hair (hypertrichosis); anemia; kidney or liver problems; and lung or heart failure. Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome (and Leigh-like syndrome, a term used for cases with similar features but that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for Leigh syndrome) may be caused by mutations in any of several genes and can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner.

People with this condition have red blood cells that are smaller than normal and have an irregular shape. HbE disease is thought to be a benign condition. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by a particular mutation in the HBB gene. The mutation that causes hemoglobin E disease has the highest frequency among people of Southeast Asian heritage (Cambodian, Laotian, Vietnamese and Thai). However, it is also found in people of Chinese, Filipino, Asiatic Indian, and Turkish descent."

While mild splenomegaly and/or anemia can occur, it is generally considered a benign condition. When a person inherits a gene mutation from one of their parents, they are said to be a carrier or have hemoglobin trait. These individuals are typically asymptomatic, although they may have small red blood cells. However, carriers may be at risk to have children with hemoglobin E/thalassemia (which is similar to thalassemia) or hemoglobin sickle E disease (milder form of sickle cell anemia). Both of these conditions are much more severe than hemoglobin E disease. They are are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."

The proteins made from these genes are either known, or thought, to affect cell structures called cilia. Cilia are projections on the cell surface that play a role in signaling. They are important for many cell types, including neurons, liver cells and kidney cells. Cilia also play a role in the senses such as sight, hearing, and smell. Mutations in the genes responsible for Joubert syndrome and related disorders cause problems with the structure and function of cilia, likely disrupting important signaling pathways during development. However, it is still unclear how specific developmental abnormalities result from these problems."

            "question": "Is Joubert syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Joubert syndrome inherited? Joubert syndrome is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. In rare cases, when Joubert syndrome is caused by mutations in the OFD1 gene on the X chromosome, it is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. X-linked recessive conditions usually occur in males, who only have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes, so if they have a mutation on one X chromosome, they still have a working copy of the gene on their other X chromosome and are typically unaffected. While females can have an X-linked recessive condition, it is very rare. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive condition and the father is not, the risk to children depends on each child's sex. Each male child has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be affected Each daughter has a 50% chance to be unaffected, and a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier If a father has the condition and the mother is not a carrier, all sons will be unaffected, and all daughters will be unaffected carriers."

The acronym LEOPARD describes the characteristic features associated with this condition: (L)entigines (multiple dark spots on the skin; (E)lectrocardiographic conduction defects (abnormalities of the electrical activity of the heart); (O)cular hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes); (P)ulmonary stenosis (obstruction of the normal outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart); (A)bnormalities of the genitalia; (R)etarded growth resulting in short stature; and (D)eafness or hearing loss. There are three types of LEOPARD syndrome, which are distinguished by their underlying genetic cause. LEOPARD syndrome type 1 is caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene; type 2 is caused by mutations in the RAF1 gene; and type 3 is caused by mutations in the BRAF gene. Some cases are inherited from a parent in an autosomal dominant pattern. Other times, LEOPARD syndrome occurs in people without a family history of the condition due to a new gene mutation."

            "answer": "Barraquer-Simons syndrome, or acquired partial lipodystrophy, is characterized by the loss of fat from the face, neck, shoulders, arms, forearms, chest and abdomen. Occasionally the groin or thighs are also affected. Onset usually begins in childhood following a viral illness. It affects females more often than males. The fat loss usually has a 18 month course, but can come and go over the course of several years.  Following puberty, affected women may experience a disproportionate accumulation of fat in the hips and lower limbs. Around 1 in 5 people with this syndrome develop membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. This kidney condition usually develops more than 10 years after the lipodystrophy's onset.

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Neurofibromatosis type 1? People affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing many different types of tumors (both cancerous and noncancerous). Almost all people with NF1 have neurofibromas, which are benign tumors that can affect nearly any nerve in the body. Most will develop these tumors on or just underneath the skin; however, neurofibromas can also grow in other places in the body and may even affect multiple nerves. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which also grow along the nerves throughout the body, are the most common cancerous tumor found in people with NF1 and occur in approximately 10% of affected people. In children with NF1, the most common tumors are optic glioma (tumors that grow along the nerve leading from the eye to the brain) and brain tumors. Optic gliomas associated with NF1 are often asymptomatic although they can lead to vision loss. Other features of NF1 may include: Caf au lait spots (flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area) Freckling, especially in the underarm and groin Lisch nodules (clumps of pigment in the colored part of the eye that do not interfere with vision) Learning disabilities Seizures Autism spectrum disorder High blood pressure Short stature An unusually large head (macrocephaly) Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis GeneReview's Web site offers more specific information about the features of NF1.

            "question": "What causes Neurofibromatosis type 1 ?",
            "answer": "What causes neurofibromatosis type 1? Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by changes (mutations) in the NF1 gene. NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene, which means that it encodes a protein that stops cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in NF1 result in an abnormal protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This contributes to the development of the many different types of tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1. People with neurofibromatosis type 1 are typically born with one mutated copy of the NF1 gene in each cell and are, therefore, genetically predisposed to develop the tumors associated with the condition. For a tumor to form, two copies of the NF1 gene must be altered. The mutation in the second copy of the NF1 gene is considered a somatic mutation because it occurs during a person's lifetime and is not inherited. Almost everyone who is born with one NF1 mutation acquires a second mutation in many cells and develops the tumors characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 1."

            "answer": "How is neurofibromatosis type 1 inherited? Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have a genetic predisposition to the tumors associated with NF1. In approximately half of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene; these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with NF1 has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "question": "How to diagnose Neurofibromatosis type 1 ?",
            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for neurofibromatosis type 1? Although it is usually not necessary for diagnosis, genetic testing is available for NF1, the gene known to cause neurofibromatosis type 1. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosed? The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is usually based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Specifically, doctors look for two or more of the following features to make a diagnosis of NF1: Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (measuring more than 5 mm across in children and more than 15 mm across in adolescents and adults) Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma (a neurofibroma that involves many nerves) Freckling in the underarm and/or groin Optic glioma Two or more Lisch nodules (clumps of pigment in the colored part of the eye that do not interfere with vision) Bone abnormalities including sphenoid dysplasia (absence of bone surrounding the eye) or tibial pseudarthrosis (incomplete healing of a fracture) A parent, sibling, or child who has been diagnosed with NF1 Because many of the features associated with NF1 develop with age, it can sometimes take several years to make a diagnosis in children without a family history of the condition. Genetic testing for changes (mutations) in the NF1 gene is available, but it is often not necessary. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis is only an option if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known."

There is currently no way to prevent or stop the growth of the tumors associated with NF1. Neurofibromas located on or just below the skin that are disfiguring or irritating may be surgically removed. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are generally treated with complete surgical excision (when possible) although some cases may require the addition of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Most optic gliomas associated with NF1 do not cause any symptoms and therefore, do not require treatment; however, optic gliomas that threaten vision may be treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy.

It gets its name from the unusual appearance of the cornea during an eye exam. This dystrophy occurs when the epithelium's basement membrane develops abnormally, causing the epithelial cells to not properly adhere to it. This leads to recurrent epithelial erosions, which can cause blurred vision and severe pain. This condition is usually not inherited.

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy? A chronic problem seen in this condition is the epithelial erosions. They can alter the cornea's normal curvature, causing periodic blurred vision. These erosions may also expose the nerve endings that line the tissue, resulting in moderate to severe pain lasting as long as several days. Generally, the pain will be worse upon awakening in the morning. Other symptoms include sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, and foreign body sensation in the eye. This condition usually affects adults between the ages of 40 and 70, although it can develop earlier in life. It gets its name from the unusual appearance of the cornea during an eye exam. Most often, the affected epithelium will have a map-like appearance, i.e., large, slightly gray outlines that look like a continent on a map. There may also be clusters of opaque dots close to the map-like patches. Less frequently, the irregular basement membrane will form concentric lines in the central cornea that resemble small fingerprints. Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy is not a progressive condition. Typically, it will flare up occasionally for a few years and then go away on its own, with no lasting loss of vision. Most people never know that they have this condition, since they do not have any pain or vision loss.

            "question": "What is (are) Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ?",
            "answer": "Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by myoclonic jerks (quick jerks of the arms or legs), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), and sometimes, absence seizures. The seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning. Seizures can be triggered by lack of sleep, extreme fatigue, stress, or alcohol consumption. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The exact cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy remains unknown, but genetics likely plays a role. Although patients usually require lifelong treatment with anticonvulsants, their overall prognosis is generally good."

            "answer": "Is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy inherited? If I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, will my children also have it? Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an inherited disorder (about a third of patients with this condition have a positive family history of epilepsy), but the exact mode of inheritance is not clear. A number of studies have indicated that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an autosomal dominant condition (i.e. 50% risk of inheritance). However, it exhibits incomplete penetrance, which means that some individuals who inherit the juvenile myoclonic epilepsy gene or genes do not express clinical juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The children of these individuals who have the gene but do not exhibit symptoms may still inherit the genes and express clinically observable disease. Due to the complex nature of inheritance with this condition, you may benefit from consulting with a genetics professional.

            "answer": "How is narcolepsy diagnosed? Narcolepsy is often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, when falling asleep suddenly in school brings the problem to attention. However, for many people with narcolepsy, the disorder is not diagnosed for up to 10-15 years after symptoms first begin. The disorder may be misdiagnosed as various other conditions or psychological problems. While it is most easily recognized if all the major symptoms are reported, making the diagnosis based solely on symptoms is difficult. People often seek medical help for single symptoms that could be associated with other disorders, particularly epilepsy. In come cases, symptoms are not dramatically apparent for years. Sleep studies are an essential part of the evaluation of people with possible narcolepsy. The combination of an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) can provide strongly suggestive evidence of narcolepsy, while excluding other sleep disorders. Measurement of hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may further help to establish the diagnosis. People with narcolepsy often have extremely low levels of hypocretin in their CSF. In some cases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing may be helpful."

            "answer": "How might narcolepsy be treated? There is currently no cure for narcolepsy, but some of the symptoms can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. Most affected people improve if they maintain a regular sleep schedule, usually 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Scheduled naps during the day also may help. Other measures that may help include participating in an exercise program; receiving emotional support and career or vocational counseling; and avoiding high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, which may make symptoms worse. Common-sense measures should be taken to enhance sleep quality (such as avoiding heavy meals before bed time). Treatment with medications involves the use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These medications help reduce daytime sleepiness and improve this symptom in 65-85% of affected people. Two types of antidepressant drugs (tricyclics, and selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors) are effective in controlling cataplexy in many people. Sodium oxybate (a strong sedative taken during the night) may also be used to treat narcolepsy. You can view detailed information about the treatment of narcolepsy on Medscape's Web site."

The disease primarily affects the small blood vessels in the white matter of the brain. CADASIL is characterized by migraine headaches and multiple strokes, which progresses to dementia. Other symptoms include white matter lesions throughout the brain, cognitive deterioration, seizures, vision problems, and psychiatric problems such as severe depression and changes in behavior and personality. Individuals may also be at higher risk of heart attack. Symptoms and disease onset vary widely, with signs typically appearing in the mid-30s. Some individuals may not show signs of the disease until later in life. CADASIL is caused by a change (or mutation) in a gene called NOTCH3 and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

Strokes may lead to severe disability such as an inability to walk and urinary incontinence. The average age at onset for stroke-like episodes is 46 years. A decline in thinking ability (cognitive deficit) is the second most common feature and occurs in over half of affected people. This may begin as early as 35 years of age. CADASIL typically causes a slow decline in thought processes, and approximately 75% of affected people eventually develop dementia (including significant difficulty with reasoning and memory). Thirty percent of people with CADASIL also experience psychiatric issues, varying from personality changes to severe depression. Migraines with aura occur in about 35% of people with CADASIL, with the first attack occurring at an average age of 26 years.

The NOTCH3 gene gives the body instructions to make the Notch3 receptor protein, needed for normal function and survival of vascular smooth muscle cells. Mutations in NOTCH3 cause the body to make an abnormal protein, thus impairing the function and survival of vascular smooth muscle cells and causing these cells to self-destruct. The loss of vascular smooth muscle cells in the brain causes blood vessel damage that leads to the characteristic features of CADASIL."

            "answer": "How is CADASIL inherited? CADASIL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause CADASIL. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In rare cases, CADASIL may result from having a new mutation in the gene, in which case it is not inherited from a parent. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the gene."

Migraine should be treated both symptomatically and prophylactically (with preventative methods), depending on the frequency of symptoms. When hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) are also present, they should be treated.

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of autoimmune atrophic gastritis? In some cases, autoimmune atrophic gastritis does not cause any obvious signs and symptoms. However, some people may experience nausea, vomiting, a feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen after eating, or abdominal pain. It is often associated with impaired absorption of vitamin B12 and possibly other vitamin deficiencies (such as folate and iron). People with vitamin B12 deficiency are at risk for pernicious anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is considered a \"precancerous\" condition and it may be responsible for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma or carcinoids."

            "question": "What causes Autoimmune atrophic gastritis ?",
            "answer": "What causes autoimmune atrophic gastritis? Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is considered an autoimmune disorder. In people who are affected by this condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells of the stomach lining. Overtime, this can wear away the stomach's protective barrier and interfere with the absorption of several key vitamins (i.e. vitamin B12, iron, folate). This leads to the signs and symptoms of autoimmune atrophic gastritis."

            "question": "Is Autoimmune atrophic gastritis inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is autoimmune atrophic gastritis inherited? In some cases, more than one family member can be affected by autoimmune atrophic gastritis. Although the underlying genetic cause has not been identified, studies suggest that the condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in these families. In autosomal dominant conditions, an affected person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with the condition has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Autoimmune atrophic gastritis ?",
            "answer": "How might autoimmune atrophic gastritis be treated? The treatment of autoimmune atrophic gastritis is generally focused on preventing and/or alleviating signs and symptoms of the condition. For example, management is focused on preventing vitamin B12, folate and iron deficiencies in the early stages of the condition. With adequate supplementation of these vitamins and minerals, anemia and other health problems may be avoided. If pernicious anemia is already present at the time of diagnosis, replacement of vitamin B12 is generally recommended via injections. In some cases, endoscopic surveillance may also be recommended due to the increased risk of certain types of cancer. While surgery may be appropriate for the treatment of related cancers, we are not aware of surgical management options or recommendations otherwise. Symptoms of gastritis in general may be managed with prescription or over-the-counter medications (besides antibiotics for H. pylori-associated gastritis) that block or reduce acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. Examples may include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole and pantoprazole. Histamine (H-2) blockers reduce the amount of acid released into the digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and promotes healing. Examples include ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine and nizatidine. Antacids that neutralize stomach acid and provide pain relief may also be used. We are not aware of dietary guidelines or recommendations for autoimmune atrophic gastritis. Much of the literature on dietary management of gastritis is specific to H. Pylori-associated gastritis. However, people with gastritis in general may find some relief by eating smaller, more-frequent meals; avoiding irritating foods; avoiding alcohol; switching pain relievers; and managing stress."

            "question": "What is (are) Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction ?",
            "answer": "Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare but serious condition characterized by repetitive episodes or continuous symptoms of bowel obstruction when no blockage exists. The most common symptoms are abdominal swelling or bloating (distention), vomiting, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, diarrhea, constipation, feeding intolerance and urinary symptoms. CIPO can occur in people of any age. It may be primary or secondary. Problems with nerves, muscles, or interstitial cells of Cajal (the cells that set the pace of intestinal contractions) prevent normal contractions and cause problems with the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines. Primary or idiopathic (where the cause is unknown) CIPO occurs by itself. Secondary CIPO develops as a complication of another medical condition. Some people with primary CIPO have gain or loss of genetic material in the FLNA gene. The diagnosis of CIPO is clinical and other conditions with similar symptoms should be ruled out. Treatment may include nutritional support, medications, decompression or surgery. Management may require specialists from a variety of backgrounds."

The classical salt wasting form of 21-hydroxylase-deficient is a severe form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. People with this condition have no 21-hydroxylase function.Within the first week of life newborns may have life threatening salt-wasting crises and low blood pressure. Females are often born with ambiguous genitalia. A close look at the hormone levels in patients with this form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency reveals an increased level of testosterone and rennin, and reduced levels of cortisol and aldosterone. Levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is over 5,000 nmol/L. What are the symptoms of simple virilizing 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia? Patients with simple virilizing 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia have some functioning 21-hydroxylase (about 1%). Females may be born with clitoral enlargement, labial fusion, and sexual ambiguity. Males may present in early childhood with signs of precocious puberty such as very early sexual development, pubic hair development, and/or growth acceleration. Untreated patients have a shorter than average adult height. A close look at hormone levels in patients with simple virilizing 21-hydroxylase deficiency reveal an increased level of testosterone, reduced level of cortisol, normal or increased level of renin, and normal levels of aldosterone. Levels of 17-Hydroxyprogesterone are 2500 to 5000 nmol/L. What are the symptoms of nonclassical 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia? People with nonclassical or late-onset 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia have 20% to 50% of 21-Hydroxylase activity. They may present in childhood or adulthood with early pubic hair growth or with symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome. In females symptoms may include excessive hair growth, absent periods, infertility, androgenic alopecia, masculinized genitalia, and acne. Height is likely to be normal. A close look at the hormone levels in patients with the nonclassical type reveal a variably increased level of testosterone and normal levels of aldosterone, renin, and cortisol.

In childhood, the overall goal is to replace cortisol. Obtaining hormonal balance is important and patients growth velocity and bone age is monitored. Routine analysis of blood, urine, and/or saliva may also be necessary. Corrective surgery is frequently required for females born with abnormal genitalia. In late childhood and adolescence, maintaining hormonal balance is equally important. Overtreatment may result in obesity and delayed menarche/puberty, whereas under-replacement will result in sexual precocity. Also, it is important that teens and young adults with 21-hydroxylase deficiency be successfully transitioned to adult care facilities. Follow-up of adult patients should involve multidisciplinary clinics. Problems in adult women include fertility concerns, excessive hair growth, and menstrual irregularity; obesity and impact of short stature; sexual dysfunction and psychological problems. Counseling may be helpful. Adult males may develop enlargement of the testes and if so, should work with an endocrinologist familiar with the management of patients with this deficiency."

            "question": "What is (are) Opitz G/BBB syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Opitz G/BBB syndrome is an inherited condition that affects several structures along the midline of the body. The most common features are wide-spaced eyes and defects of the larynx, trachea, and/or esophagus causing breathing problems and difficulty swallowing. Affected males usually have a urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Other features can include mild intellectual disability, cleft lip and/or a cleft palate, heart defects, an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), agenesis of the corpus callosum, and facial abnormalities. These features may vary, even among members of the same family. There are two forms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and patterns of inheritance. The X-linked form is caused by mutations in the MID1 gene. Autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by a deletion of 22q11.2, and is often referred to as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Treatment depends on the individuals specific needs."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome? Opitz G/BBB syndrome mainly affects structures along the midline of the body. The most common features of the condition are wide-spaced eyes (hypertelorism); defects of the larynx, trachea, and/or esophagus causing breathing problems and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); and in males, the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Mild intellectual disability and developmental delay occur in about 50 percent of people with Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Delays in motor skills, speech delays, and learning difficulties may also occur. Some individuals with Opitz G/BBB syndrome have features similar to autistic spectrum disorders, including impaired communication and socialization skills. About half of affected individuals also have cleft lip with or without a cleft palate. Some have cleft palate alone. Heart defects, an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), and brain defects such as an absence of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum) occur in less than 50 percent of those affected. Facial abnormalities that may be seen in this disorder can include a flat nasal bridge, thin upper lip, and low set ears. These features vary among affected individuals, even within the same family. The signs and symptoms of the autosomal dominant form of the condition are comparable to those seen in the X-linked form. However, the X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome tends to include cleft lip with or without cleft palate, while cleft palate alone is more common in the autosomal dominant form. Females with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome are usually mildly affected, as hypertelorism may be the only sign of the disorder.

            "question": "What causes Opitz G/BBB syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Opitz G/BBB syndrome? The X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by mutations in the MID1 gene. The MID1 gene provides instructions for making a specific protein called midline-1. This protein helps regulate the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration). The MID1 gene is a member of a group of genes called the TRIM (tripartite motif) family. The proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. Primarily, TRIM proteins play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As part of its protein degrading function, midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including phosphatase 2A (PP2A), integrin alpha-4 (ITGA4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (STK36). The recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are needed for normal cellular functioning. Mutations in the MID1 gene lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents this protein recycling. As a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they accumulate in cells. This buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. Researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Some people who have a family history of X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome have no detectable MID1 mutation. The reason for this is not yet known, although some researchers have suggested the involvement of other unknown genes. The autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, specifically 22q11.2, which is why researchers consider this condition to be part of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It is not yet known which deleted gene(s) within this region of chromosome 22 specifically cause the signs and symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. In others with autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome, the cause is related to a mutation in the SPECCIL gene. Click on the gene name to learn more about its role in the development of this condition."

            "question": "Is Opitz G/BBB syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is Opitz G/BBB syndrome inherited? Opitz G/BBB syndrome often has an X-linked  pattern of inheritance. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. This is because females have two different X chromosomes in each cell, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons, because fathers only pass a Y chromosome on to their sons (which is what makes them male). In some cases, an affected person inherits a MID1 mutation from an affected parent, while in other cases, it may result from a new mutation in the affected individual. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A female who has the X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have a daughter with the mutation, a 25% chance to have a son with the mutation, a 25% chance to have an unaffected daughter, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. This also means that there is a 50% chance, with each pregnancy, for the child to inherit the mutation. A male with the X-linked dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome will pass the mutation on to all of his daughters and none of his sons. Researchers have also described an autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome caused by a deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from a parent, while in other cases, the condition results from a new deletion in the affected individual. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Males and females with the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome usually have the same degree of severity of symptoms. A male or female who has the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance with each pregnancy for the child (male or female) to inherit the genetic abnormality."

In order to differentiate the X-linked form from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (the autosomal dominant form), the pattern of inheritance within the family may be assessed. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the MID1 gene is available for confirmation. Between 15 and 45% of males with clinically diagnosed Opitz G/BBB syndrome are found to have a mutation in this gene."

Some NR0B1 mutations result in the production of an inactive version of the DAX1 protein, while other mutations delete the entire gene. The resulting shortage of DAX1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. The signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occur when endocrine glands do not produce the right amounts of certain hormones."

            "question": "Is X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited? X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. In rare cases, however, females who carry a NR0B1 mutation may experience adrenal insufficiency or signs of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism such as underdeveloped reproductive tissues, delayed puberty, and an absence of menstruation."

            "answer": "Osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OI type III) is a form of osteogenesis imperfecta, a group of genetic conditions that primarily affect the bones. In OI type III, specifically, a diagnosis can often be made shortly after birth as fractures (broken bones) during the newborn period simply from handling the infant are common. Other signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person but may include severe bone fragility, bone malformations, short stature, dental problems (dentinogenesis imperfect), macrocephaly (unusually large head), hearing loss, and blue sclerae (whites of the eyes). Most affected people are unable to walk without assistance. OI type III is caused by changes (mutations) in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

            "answer": "Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is a group of genetic disorders that result in muscle weakness and fatigue. Symptoms can range from mild weakness to progressive disabling weakness. There are three main subtypes of CMS, which are defined by how they affect the connection between muscles and the nervous system: postsynaptic (75-80% of patients), synaptic (14-15% of patients), and presynaptic (7-8% of patients). Identification of the specific subtype is important in patient care for determining the most effective treatment. Mutations in many genes have been found to cause CMS, and most forms of CMS are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. One form of CMS, a postsynaptic form known as slow-channel syndrome congenital myasthenic syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

            "question": "Is Congenital myasthenic syndrome inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is congenital myasthenic syndrome inherited? Almost all types of CMS are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In order to have the autosomal recessive form of CMS, both parents of an affected individual must be carriers of the disease causing mutation. If a person has CMS, but their partner is not a carrier of a CMS mutation, then their children will be carriers but will not have CMS. If one person has CMS and one person is a carrier of CMS, each child has a 50% chance of either being a carrier of CMS or having the disorder. Only one form of CMS (slow-channel syndrome congenital myasthenic syndrome) has been shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if one parent has slow-channel syndrome congenital myasthenic syndrome then all of their children have a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder as well. It is important to discuss this information with your health care provider, such as a genetic counselor, to accurately determine a person's risk for passing on this disorder."

Two forms of Robinow syndrome have been described: autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome, and the milder autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome. They are distinguished based on their modes of inheritance, symptoms, and severity. Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome causes shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs; short fingers and toes; wedge-shaped spinal bones leading to kyphoscoliosis; fused or missing ribs; short stature; and distinctive facial features. Other features may include underdeveloped genitalia; dental problems; kidney or heart defects; or delayed development. This form is caused by mutations in the ROR2 gene. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome causes more mild, but similar, features. There are rarely spine and rib abnormalities, and short stature is less severe. A variant type of this form is additionally characterized by osteosclerosis. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome may be caused by a mutation in the WNT5A or DVL1 gene. In some cases, the underlying cause of Robinow syndrome is unknown. Management may include bracing or surgery for skeletal abnormalities and growth hormone to increase growth rate in affected children."

Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance means both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with AR Robinow syndrome usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically are unaffected. When two carriers of AR Robinow syndrome have children together, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not a carrier. Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance means that having only one mutated copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. Some people with AD Robinow syndrome inherit the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation that causes the condition occurs for the first time in the affected person.

Isolated HSCR has multifactorial inheritance, which means that multiple genes interact with environmental factors to cause the condition. When someone has a child with isolated HSCR, the overall risk to have another child with the condition is 4%. There are some factors that can change the risk. For example, the risk is higher if the sibling has long-segment disease rather than short-segment disease. Also males are more likely than females to develop HSCR. Another factor is if the siblings have the same or different parents.  If HSCR occurs as part of a genetic syndrome, then it is inherited in a specific pattern. For example, the inheritance may be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive, depending on the exact cause of the syndrome.  Individuals who are interested in learning about their personal risks or risks to family members should speak with their health care provider or a genetics professional."

            "answer": "Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage (particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs) to bone. It is characterized by dwarfism, limited range of motion at the elbows, large head size, small fingers, and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia can cause health complications such as apnea, obesity, recurrent ear infections, and lordosis of the spine. Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. Researchers believe that these mutations cause the FGFR3 protein to be overly active, which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen in this condition."

The signs and symptoms associated with the condition are thought to be due to improper development of the outer surface of the brain (cerebral cortex) during embryonic growth. The cerebral cortex, which is responsible for conscious movement and thought, normally consists of several deep folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci). However, in people affected by BPP, the cerebral cortex has an abnormally increased number of gyri that are unusually small. Scientists believe that these abnormalities occur when newly developed brain cells fail to migrate to their destined locations in the outer portion of the brain. Specific non-genetic causes of polymicrogyria have been recognized, including exposure to cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) during pregnancy. Polymicrogyria has also been associated with certain complications in twin pregnancies."

It can occur at any age, but is usually diagnosed in young adulthood. People with PNH have recurring episodes of symptoms due to hemolysis, which may be triggered by stresses on the body such as infections or physical exertion. This results in a deficiency of various types of blood cells and can cause signs and symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, abnormally pale skin (pallor), shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. People with PNH may also be prone to infections and abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis) or hemorrhage, and are at increased risk of developing leukemia. It is caused by acquired, rather than inherited, mutations in the PIGA gene; the condition is not passed down to children of affected individuals. Sometimes, people who have been treated for aplastic anemia may develop PNH. The treatment of PNH is largely based on symptoms; stem cell transplantation is typically reserved for severe cases of PNH with aplastic anemia or those whose develop leukemia."

There are three forms of VLCAD deficiency: a severe, early-onset form; a hepatic (liver) or hypoketotic hypoglycemic form; and a later-onset episodic myopathic form. Signs and symptoms of the severe, early-onset form occur in the first few months of life and include cardiomyopathy (heart disease), pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart), heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart beat), low muscle tone, enlarged liver, and intermittent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The heart problems can be life threatening, but are often improved with early treatment and diet modifications. People affected by the hepatic or hypoketotic hypoglycemic form typically develop symptoms during early childhood. These features may include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and enlarged liver (without cardiomyopathy). \"Hypoketotic\" refers to a low level of ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats and used for energy. Hypoglycemia refers to low blood sugar. Together, these signs are called \"hypoketotic hypoglycemia.\" The episodes of hypoglycemia seen in the early-onset form and hepatic/hypoketotic hypoglycemia form can cause a child to feel weak, shaky and/or dizzy with clammy, cold skin. If not treated, it can lead to coma, and possibly death. Periods of hypoglycemia can also occur with other symptoms as part of a metabolic crisis. Signs and symptoms of the later-onset episodic myopathic form may include intermittent rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle), muscle cramps, muscle pain, and exercise intolerance. It is the most common form of VLCAD deficiency."

This gene encodes an enzyme that is required for the proper break down (metabolism) of a certain group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. Mutations in the ACADVL gene lead to reduced levels of this enzyme which prevents the proper metabolism of these fats. Because very long-chain fatty acids are an important source of energy, particularly for the heart and muscles, this may result in certain symptoms such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Fats that are not properly broken down can also build-up and damage tissues such as the heart, liver, and muscles, which can cause the other features seen in people with VLCAD deficiency."

            "answer": "How might VLCAD deficiency be treated? Management of VLCAD deficiency depends on many factors, including the form of the condition and the specific signs and symptoms present. For example, people affected by the severe forms of the condition are typically placed on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with frequent meals. Supplemental calories may be provided through medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil). If hospitalization is necessary for acute episodes of hypoglycemia and/or metabolic crisis, intravenous glucose may be administered as an energy source. Periods of rhabdomyolysis may be treated with hydration and alkalization of the urine (decreasing the amount of acid you take in) to protect kidney function and to prevent acute kidney failure. Affected people are generally advised to avoid fasting, dehydration, and a high-fat diet."

            "answer": "Achondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that are present from birth and affect the development of cartilage and bone. Infants with achondrogenesis usually have a small body, short arms and legs, and other skeletal abnormalities that cause life-threatening complications.  There are at least three forms of achondrogenesis, type 1A, type 1B and type 2, which are distinguished by signs and symptoms, pattern of inheritance, and the results of imaging studies such as x-rays (radiology), tissue analysis (histology), and genetic testing.  Type 1A and 1B achondrogenesis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Type 1B may be caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene.  Type 2 achondrogenesis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by new (de novo) mutations in the COL2A1 gene."

The genetic cause of achondrogenesis type 1A remains unknown.  The SLC26A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for the normal development of cartilage and for the conversion of cartilage to bone. The COL2A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a type of collagen found mostly in cartilage and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (vitreous).  Mutations in these genes result in the production of proteins that are unable to properly perform their jobs within the body."

            "answer": "How is achondrogenesis inherited? Achondrogenesis type 1A and type 1B are believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.  Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Achondrogenesis type 2 is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. It is almost always caused by new (de novo) mutations and typically occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

Many of the individuals affected by IC are women. Because IC varies so much in symptoms and severity, most researchers believe it is not one, but several diseases. In recent years, scientists have started to use the terms bladder pain syndrome (BPS) or painful bladder syndrome (PBS) to describe cases with painful urinary symptoms that may not meet the strictest definition of IC. While there is no cure for IC/PBS, in many cases, the symptoms can be managed. Treatments include dietary and lifestyle changes; distending, or inflating, the bladder; bathing the inside of the bladder with a medicine solution; oral medicines and in rare cases, surgery."

It usually develops in children or young adults, but can affect people of any age. An IMT can occur in almost any part of the body but is most commonly found in the lung, orbit (eye socket), peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity and internal organs), and mesentery. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the site of the tumor. Some people with an IMT are asymptomatic, while others may have nonspecific respiratory symptoms, fever, or pain. IMTs may recur, and occasionally become locally invasive and/or spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The underlying cause of IMTs is poorly understood. Some cases have been linked to translocations involving the ALK gene. Treatment involves surgical removal when possible, although there are reports of treatment with oral steroids and radiation therapy."

            "answer": "What causes Mowat-Wilson syndrome? Mowat-Wilson syndrome is caused by mutations in the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. It is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that ZEB2 protein is involved in the development of tissues that give rise to the nervous system, digestive tract, facial features, heart, and other organs. Mowat-Wilson syndrome almost always results from the loss of one working copy of the ZEB2 gene in each cell. In some cases, the entire gene is deleted. In other cases, mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ZEB2 protein. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal development of many organs and tissues, which causes the varied signs and symptoms of Mowat-Wilson syndrome."

The signs and symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency can vary widely among affected people. Early-onset DLD deficiency typically appears in early infancy with decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), lethargy, and lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. Symptoms typically occur in episodes that may be triggered by illness, injury, or other stresses on the body. Affected infants often do not survive their initial episode or may die within the first few years of life during a recurrent episode. Children who live beyond the first two to three years often have growth delays and neurological problems such as intellectual disability, spasticity, ataxia, and seizures. However, normal intellect has been reported in a few people with the early-onset form of DLD deficiency. Isolated liver involvement, which can range from hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to life-threatening liver failure, can also occur in the newborn period, or as late as the 3rd decade of life.

            "question": "What causes Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?",
            "answer": "What causes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency? Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the DLD gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). DLD is one part of 3 different groups of enzymes that work together (enzyme complexes). These enzyme complexes are involved in breaking down amino acids commonly found in protein-rich foods, and in other reactions that help to convert energy from food into a form that our cells can use. Mutations in the DLD gene impair the function of DLD, preventing the 3 enzyme complexes from functioning properly. This causes a build-up of molecules that are normally broken down, which in turn leads to tissue damage, lactic acidosis and other chemical imbalances. The brain is especially sensitive to the buildup of molecules and lack of cellular energy, which is why there are neurological problems associated with DLD deficiency."

            "question": "Is Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency inherited ?",
            "answer": "How is dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency inherited? Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% to be unaffected and not be a carrier."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency ?",
            "answer": "How might dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency be treated? There are currently no consensus recommendations for the management of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency. Management can be hard because various metabolic pathways are affected and 3 enzyme complexes are involved. Deficiencies in enzyme pathways vary depending on the specific mutation(s) each affected person has. Unfortunately, the treatments that have been attempted in children with the early-onset neurologic form do not appear to significantly alter the course of the disease. Even with treatment, children often do not survive infancy or have varying degrees of chronic neurologic impairment if they survive the initial episode. Depending on individual enzyme complex deficiencies, treatment may involve certain dietary restrictions or certain diets; use of medical foods; and/or supplementation of specific amino acids or other substances. There is limited data for the chronic management of people with the primarily hepatic (liver-related) form of the disease. Management typically involves supportive therapy during times of acute liver injury or failure, and may include nutritional support; IV glucose for hypoglycemia; correction of metabolic acidosis; correction of coagulopathy; and avoidance of liver-toxic medications. More detailed information about the management of DLD deficiency can be viewed on the GeneReviews Web site. GeneReviews is intended for use by genetics professionals. Those not familiar with the principles discussed on the GeneReviews Web site are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional or other healthcare provider regarding information of interest."

PBD-ZSS is a group of inherited genetic disorders that damage the white matter of the brain and affect motor movements.  Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, in turn, are part of a larger group of disorders called leukodystrophies. IRD can cause low muscle tone (hypotonia), retinitis pigmentosa (a visual impairment that can lead to blindness), developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and liver dysfunction. IRD usually presents at birth or in infancy. Most individuals with IRD can achieve motor milestones, though they may be delayed, and most individuals can communicate with a few words or signs. Leukodystrophy with loss of acquired skills can occur at any age and may stabilize or progress. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders are caused by mutations in one of the PEX genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  Life expectancy, medical complications, and the degree of neurological impairment can vary. Survival into adulthood is possible.

These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type VI collagen. This protein plays an important role in muscle, particularly skeletal muscle. Type VI collagen makes up part of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support to the muscles. Mutations in the type VI collagen genes result in the formation of abnormal type VI collagen or reduced amounts of type VI collagen. This decrease in normal type VI collagen disrupts the extracellullar matrix surrounding muscle cells, leading to progressive muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of Bethlem myopathy."

It is characterized by long QT syndrome, although some people with Timothy syndrome also have other heart defects that affect the hearts ability to pump blood effectively. Other symptoms of Timothy syndrome include fusion of the skin between fingers or toes and distinctive facial features. In addition, many children with this syndrome have developmental delay and characteristic features of autism. Mental retardation and seizures can also occur in children with Timothy syndrome. There are two forms of Timothy syndrome. Type 1 includes all of the characteristic features described. Type 2 causes a more severe form of long QT syndrome and does not appear to cause fusion of skin between fingers or toes. All cases of Timothy syndrome appear to be due to changes in the CACNA1C gene. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, most cases are not inherited from an affected parent, but occur for the first time in a family due to a spontaneous or random change in the CACNA1C gene."

Congenital anosmia may occur as an isolated abnormality or be associated with specific genetic disorders (such as Kallmann syndrome and congenital insensitivity to pain). Most cases of isolated congenital anosmia (not associated with additional symptoms) occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. In these people, the exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Most likely, there is more than one cause. Scientists suspect that the condition occurs due to abnormal development of the olfactory system (the sensory system used for sense of smell) prior to birth. This may include abnormalities of the nasal cavity, disruptions in the pathway that carries information from the nose to the brain, and/or malformations of the portion of the brain that processes sense of smell. Rarely, isolated congenital anosmia can affect more than one family member. This suggests that there may be a genetic component in some cases. One study found that some people affected by isolated congenital anosmia have changes (mutations) in PROKR2 or PROK2, two genes that have previously been reported in people with Kallmann syndrome (an inherited condition associated with congenital anosmia and other symptoms).

Congenital anosmia can also by associated with specific genetic disorders such as Kallmann syndrome and congenital insensitivity to pain. In these cases, the inheritance varies based on the associated condition. For example, Kallmann syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner depending on the underlying genetic cause (it can be caused by mutations in several different genes). Congenital insensitivity to pain follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

            "answer": "Alopecia universalis (AU) is a condition characterized by the complete loss of hair on the scalp and body. It is an advanced form of alopecia areata, a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. Although the exact cause of AU is unknown, it is thought to be an autoimmune condition in which an affected person's immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles. Roughly 20% of affected people have a family member with alopecia, suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to the development of AU. There is currently no cure for AU, but sometimes hair regrowth occurs on it's own, even after many years."

Although these is no therapy approved for the treatment of alopecia universalis, some people find that medications approved for other purposes may help hair grow back, at least temporarily. Since alopecia universalis is one of the more severe types of alopecia areata, treatment options are somewhat limited. The most common treatments include corticosteriods and topical (applied to the skin) immunotherapy. There are possible side effects of corticosteriods which should be discussed with a physician. Also, regrown hair is likely to fall out when the corticosteriods are stopped. About 40% of people treated with topical immunotherapy will regrow scalp hair after about six months of treatment. Those who do successfully regrow scalp hair need to continue the treatment to maintain the hair regrowth. While these treatments may promote hair growth, they do not prevent new loss or cure the underlying disease. For those who do not respond to treatment, wigs are an option."

It can affect both men and women throughout life, although the average age of onset is 30 years. Lesions typically begin as small papules with silvery scales that eventually grow and form red-brown nodules with a central keratin (horny) plug. The lesions occur mostly on the legs but also develop on the arms and the head and neck region. They are not typically painful may cause intense itching (pruritus). The cause of the disease is unknown; some cases appear to be idiopathic (no known cause) or inherited. The aim of treatment is to treat the underlying disease if one is associated. Lesions may self-heal without any treatment, but new lesions usually develop. Treatments that have been used to treat and reduce lesions include isotretinoin, high dose vitamin A, and tretinoin cream; emollients (skin softening agents) and oral antihistamines may be useful in relieving pruritus."

Therefore, treatment is typically directed toward the underlying condition when appropriate. For individuals in whom itching is a major problem, soothing antipruritic lotions containing menthol and camphor may be helpful. Sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine may also be helpful for pruritus, especially at night. Some improvement has been reported with high doses of vitamin A, with or without vitamin E. Topical retinoic acid cream may also improve the symptoms. Another approach to treatment uses oral retinoids, which resulted in alleviation of symptoms in one study. Etretinate in high doses is also reportedly effective, but relapse has been reported following discontinuation of therapy. UV light therapy is reportedly particularly helpful for individuals with widespread lesions or coexisting pruritus from renal or hepatic disease. Carbon dioxide laser or cryosurgery may be helpful for limited lesions, but caution may be recommended for individuals with dark skin, especially with cryosurgery, and for lesions on the lower legs, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or poor circulation."

            "answer": "What causes Trisomy 18? In most cases, trisomy 18 is caused by having 3 copies of chromosome 18 in each cell in the body, instead of the usual 2 copies. The extra genetic material from the 3rd copy of the chromosome disrupts development, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. About 5% of people with trisomy 18 have 'mosaic trisomy 18' (when there is an extra copy of the chromosome in only some of the body's cells). The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the number and locations of cells with the extra copy. Very rarely, an extra piece of chromosome 18 is attached to another chromosome; this is called translocation trisomy 18, or partial trisomy 18. If only part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 is present in 3 copies, the features may be less severe than in people with full trisomy 18."

            "question": "Is Trisomy 18 inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is trisomy 18 inherited? Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited and occur randomly due to errors in the formation of eggs or sperm. If an egg or sperm gains an extra copy of chromosome 18 during cell division and contributes to a pregnancy, the embryo will have an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy) in each cell of the body. Mosaic trisomy 18 (when some body cells have trisomy 18 and some have a normal chromosome make-up), is also typically not inherited. Mosaic trisomy 18 is also due to an error in cell division, but the error occurs early in embryonic development. About 5% of affected people have a mosaic form of trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18 (when only part of chromosome 18 is present in 3 copies) can be inherited. An unaffected parent can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra or missing genetic material. However, a person with a balanced translocation has an increased risk with each pregnancy to have a child with trisomy 18."

It is characterized by a noncancerous mass or tumor.

Symptoms might include: pain, limitation of movement, and locking of the joint. In some cases, the normal joint structure can be destroyed. The knee is most commonly affected by this condition, though it can occur in other joints such as the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and rarely the jaw. The average age of diagnosis for this condition is 35 years. The cause of PVNS is grossly unknown. Treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor and damaged portions of the synovium."

Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is diagnosed via physician examination, imaging studies, and sometimes surgical procedures. Imaging studies commonly used include: X-ray, MRI, and CT scan. MRI findings are diagnostic in more than 95% of patients. CT scan findings are additionally often diagnostic, though they might not show the extent of the disease. Other methods that might be utilized in the diagnostic process include joint aspiration, in which a needle is used to remove fluid from the joint and a biopsy, in which a small operation is completed to obtain a tissue sample."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Pigmented villonodular synovitis ?",
            "answer": "How might pigmented villonodular synovitis be treated? Pigmented villonodular synovitis is first treated with surgery to remove as much of the abnormal tissue growth as possible.  The type of surgery depends on the location and extent of the disease within the joint.  Radiation therapy is sometimes used to treat this condition if surgery is not an option, or if the condition returns (recurs) after an initial surgery."

            "question": "What is (are) Q fever ?",
            "answer": "Q fever is a worldwide disease with acute and chronic stages caused by the bacteria known as Coxiella burnetii. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in birth fluids, milk, urine, and feces of infected animals and are able to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection. In less than 5% of cases the affected people with acute Q fever infection develop a chronic Q fever. Treatment of the acute form is made with antibiotics. The chronic form's treatment depend on the symptoms."

Episodes of myoclonus may be brought on by physical exertion, stress, light, or other stimuli. Affected individuals usually begin showing signs and symptoms of the disorder between the ages of 6 and 15. Over time, the myoclonic episodes may become severe enough to interfere with walking and other everyday activities. Other features include seizures involving loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and convulsions (tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures). Like the myoclonic episodes, these may increase in frequency over several years but may be controlled with treatment. After several years of progression, the frequency of seizures may stabilize or decrease. Unverricht-Lundborg disease is caused by mutation in the CSTB gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

It may also be found in the legs, trunk, head or neck regions.  It is rare in young children and adults, and it occurs more frequently in men.  Epithelioid sarcoma begins as a painless, firm growth or bump that may be accompanied by an open wound (ulceration) in the skin covering the growth.  It is considered an aggressive cancer because it has a high chance of regrowing after treatment (a recurrence), or spreading to surrounding tissues or more distant parts of the body (a metastasis).  Epithelioid sarcoma is first treated with surgery to remove all the cancer cells (wide local excision).  Amputation of part of the affected limb may be needed in severe cases.

There are three different forms of mercury that can cause health problems: Elemental mercury (also known as liquid mercury or quicksilver) can be found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, dental fillings and fluorescent light bulbs. This form of mercury is generally only harmful when small droplets become airborne and are inhaled. If this occurs, signs and symptoms of poisoning may include metallic taste, vomiting, difficulty breathing, coughing, and/or swollen, bleeding gums. In severe cases, long-term brain damage, permanent lung damage and even death may occur. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, and some disinfectants. This form of mercury is harmful when swallowed. Signs and symptoms of inorganic mercury poisoning vary based on the amount consumed, but may include burning in the stomach and throat; vomiting; and/or bloody diarrhea. Inorganic mercury can also affect the kidneys and brain if it enters the blood stream. Organic mercury can be found in fish. Some organisms convert fumes from burning coal into organic mercury. This form of mercury is harmful if inhaled, eaten, or placed on the skin for long periods of time. Long-term exposure to organic mercury may result in skin numbness or pain; tremor; inability to walk well; blindness; double vision; memory problems; seizures; or even death.

            "answer": "Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) is characterized by the rapid accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell and are part of the immune system. IAEP can occur at any age but most commonly affects otherwise healthy individuals between 20 and 40 years of age. Signs and symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), muscle pain, and chest pain. IAEP can progress rapidly to acute respiratory failure. The term idiopathic means the exact cause for the overproduction of eosinophils is not known. Possible triggers of acute eosinophilic pneumonia include cigarette smoking, occupational exposure to dust and smoke, and certain medications. Diagnosis of IAEP generally involves a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Treatment with corticosteroids is effective in most cases. Because IAEP often progresses rapidly, respiratory failure can occur; in these cases, mechanical ventilation is required."

It occurs in one in 40,000 newborns and girls are four times more likely to be affected than boys.  Though it is usually benign, there is a possibility that the teratoma could become malignant.  As such, the recommended treatment of a teratoma is complete removal of the tumor by surgery, performed soon after the birth.  If not all of the tumor is removed during the initial surgery, the teratoma may grow back (recur) and additional surgeries may be needed.  Studies have found that sacrococcygeal teratomas recur in up to 22% of cases."

The lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid are the most commonly involved sites. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is the most commonly associated tumor and often occurs in infants and young children. Cysts in the kidneys (cystic nephroma) are also associated with DICER1 syndrome. These cysts typically develop in childhood, but do not usually cause any health problems. Women with DICER1 syndrome are at an increased risk for Sertoli-Leydig tumors of the ovaries. DICER1 syndrome is also associated with goiter (multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors in the thyroid gland). These goiters typically occur in adulthood and most often do not cause symptoms. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene. It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. Affected members in the same family can be very differently affected."

There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The signs, symptoms and severity of the condition vary by subtype. Cutaneous mastocytosis is usually caused by changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. Most cases are caused by somatic mutations which are not inherited or passed on to the next generation. However, it can rarely affect more than one family member and be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

There are three main forms that vary in severity: maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (also called urticaria pigmentosa), solitary cutaneous mastocytoma, and diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis, is characterized by itchy, brown patches on the skin. Although these patches may be mistaken for freckles or bug bites initially, they typically persist and gradually increase in number over several months to years. In young children, the patches may form a blister if itched or rubbed. Itching may worsen with changes in temperature, strenuous activity, emotional stress, and/or certain medications. Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis is most commonly seen in infants and young children and often fades by the teenaged years. In some cases, this condition may not develop until adulthood. These later onset cases generally last long-term and are more likely to progress to systemic mastocytosis. Solitary cutaneous mastocytoma is a localized form of cutaneous mastocytosis. Like maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, this form is typically diagnosed in young children. However, it is characterized by an itchy area of reddish or brown skin that is often thickened. When itched, these patches of skin may swell, redden, and/or blister. This form typically resolves spontaneously with age. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, the most severe form of cutaneous mastocytosis, usually develops in infancy. Unlike the other forms of cutaneous mastocytosis, it affects most or all of the skin rather than appearing as distinct patches. In people affected by this condition, the skin is leathery and thickened. It may appear normal, yellowish-brown, or red in color. In some cases, there may also be widespread blistering. Additional symptoms may include hypotension, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, reddening of the skin (flushing), and anaphylactic shock. The rarest form of cutaneous mastocytosis is called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. Unlike the other forms of cutaneous mastocytosis, this form is primarily diagnosed in adults and is generally not associated with pruritus and blistering. People affected by this condition have persistent brown patches of skin and extensive telegiactasia. Rarely, this form may progress to systemic mastocytosis. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cutaneous mastocytosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What causes Cutaneous mastocytosis ?",
            "answer": "What causes cutaneous mastocytosis? Most cases of cutaneous mastocytosis are caused by changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division; survival; and movement. This protein is also important for the development of certain types of cells, including mast cells (immune cells that are important for the inflammatory response). Certain mutations in the KIT gene can leads to an overproduction of mast cells. In cutaneous mastocytosis, excess mast cells accumulate in the skin, leading to the many signs and symptoms of the condition."

        {
            "question": "Is Cutaneous mastocytosis inherited ?",
            "answer": "Is cutaneous mastocytosis inherited? Most cases of cutaneous mastocytosis are not inherited. They occur spontaneously in families with no history of the condition and are due to somatic changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. Somatic mutations occur after conception and are only present in certain cells. Because they are not present in the germ cells (egg and sperm), they are not passed on to the next generation. Cutaneous mastocytosis can rarely affect more than one family member. In these cases, the condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. A person with familial cutaneous mastocytosis has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."

            "answer": "How is cutaneous mastocytosis diagnosed? A diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis is typically suspected based on the presence of suspicious signs and symptoms. A skin biopsy that reveals a high number of mast cells (immune cells that are important for the inflammatory response) confirms the diagnosis. Unfortunately it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate cutaneous mastocytosis from systemic mastocytosis. Additional tests may, therefore, be ordered to further investigate the risk for systemic disease. A bone marrow biopsy and specialized blood tests may be recommended in adults with cutaneous mastocytosis since they are at a higher risk for systemic mastocytosis. Affected children typically do not undergo a bone marrow biopsy unless blood tests are abnormal."

In general, it is recommended that affected people avoid things that trigger or worsen their symptoms when possible. Certain medications such as oral antihistamines and topical steroids are often prescribed to relieve symptoms. Affected adults may also undergo photochemotherapy which can help alleviate itching and improve the appearance of the patches; however, the condition is likely to recur within six to twelve months of the last treatment. People at risk for anaphylactic shock and/or their caregivers should be trained in how to recognize and treat this life-threatening reaction and should carry an epinephrine autoinjector at all times."

The conditions are progressive, leading to a loss of muscle strength and bulk over a number of years. Onset may occur in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Most forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several rare forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. While there are no treatments which directly reverse the muscle weakness associated with this condition, supportive treatment can decrease the complications.

Unfortunately, no definitive treatments or effective medications for the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) currently exist. Management depends on each individual and the specific type of LGMD that the individual has. However, a general approach to managing LGMD has been proposed, based on the typical progression and complications of affected individuals. This approach may include: weight control to avoid obesity; physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures (fixed tightening of the muscles); use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility; monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis; monitoring respiratory function and use of respiratory aids when needed; monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy in the types of LGMD with known occurrence of cardiac involvement; and social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity, and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders."

The muscle pain is often confused with fibromyalgia and the joint pain is sometimes confused with gout. The pain symptoms are usually the result of inflammation in the lining of the abdomen, lungs, joints, heart, pelvis, and/or in the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Headaches and amyloidosis may also occur. The majority of people with FMF experience their first episode by age 20.

In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with FMF inherited in an autosomal dominant manner has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. In some cases, FMF may appear to be autosomal dominant when it is actually autosomal recessive. This phenomenon is called pseudodominance. This may happen in families if one parent is an unaffected, unknown carrier (with 1 mutation) and the other parent is affected (with 2 mutations).

How he or she responds to colchicine treatment. Usually a positive family history in people of Middle Eastern ancestry. The results of genetic testing. Also helpful in establishing a correct diagnosis of FMF is the person's ancestry. Testing for the following can also be helpful: Elevated white blood cell count, which is an indication of an immune response. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is an indication of an inflammatory response. Elevated plasma fibrinogen, which helps stop bleeding. An elevated amount would indicate that something might be wrong with this mechanism. Elevated serum haptoglobin, which would indicate that red blood cells are being destroyed, a common occurrence in rheumatic diseases, such as FMF. Elevated C-reactive protein, which is a special type of protein, produced by the liver, that is only present during episodes of acute inflammation. Elevated albumin in the urine, which is demonstrated by urinalysis. The presence of the protein albumin in the urine can be a symptom of kidney disease, along with microscopic hematuria (very small - microscopic - amounts of blood or blood cells in the urine), during attacks. Is genetic testing for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) available? Yes. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic testing for this condition.

A common therapy for FMF is daily use of the drug colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation. Many people require colchicine for life. This therapy has been successful in preventing attacks of fever in 75 percent of those who take the drug regularly. Over 90 percent of people with FMF demonstrate a marked improvement. Even if colchicine does not prevent the fever attacks, it does prevent the amyloidosis. However, compliance in taking colchicine every day is very important. If a person stops taking the drug, an attack can occur within a few days. Complications of colchicine use can also occur and include muscle weakness (myopathy) and a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like reaction. Since the gene that causes FMF codes for the protein pyrin, researchers hope that by studying how this protein works they will ultimately develop improved treatments for FMF, and possibly for other conditions involving excess inflammation."

            "question": "What causes Moyamoya disease ?",
            "answer": "What causes Moyamoya disease? In some families, risk for moyamoya disease is inherited. Changes in the RNF213 gene have been associated with the condition. There are other gene changes involved in moyamoya disease, that remain to be found. Factors such as infection or inflammation, likely also play a role in the condition's development in these families. Other people develop moyamoya syndrome or phenomenon. Moyamoya syndrome can occur in association with many different conditions, such as with infections, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), blood disorders (for example sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia), vasculitis, autoimmune conditions (for example Lupus, thyroid disorders, Sneddon syndrome), connective tissue disorders (for example neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 or Tuberous sclerosis), chromosome disorders, metabolic diseases, head trauma or radiation, brain tumors, and heart disease, to name a few."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Moyamoya disease ?",
            "answer": "How might Moyamoya disease be treated? Treatment for Moyamoya disease should begin early in the disease course to prevent severe complications. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, and is the only viable long-term treatment. There are several types of revascularization surgeries that can restore blood flow to the brain by opening narrowed blood vessels, or by bypassing blocked arteries. While children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults, the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery. No medication can stop the narrowing of the brain's blood vessels, or the development of the thin, fragile vessels that characterize the disease. However, medications are used to treat many of the symptoms of the disease, and are often an important part of the management. Medications may include aspirin (to prevent or reduce the development of small blood clots); calcium channel blockers (which may improve symptoms of headaches and reduce symptoms related to transient ischemic attacks); and anti-seizure medications (when needed for a seizure disorder). In a few cases, anticoagulants may be needed for people with unstable or frequent symptoms. However, they are not used long-term due to the risk of cerebral bleeding. Additional information about the treatment of Moyamoya disease is available on Medscape Reference's Web site. People interested in learning about specific treatment options for themselves or family members should speak with their health care provider."

            "answer": "What causes ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency? Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is caused by mutations in the OTC gene. OTC deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. It processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. In OTC deficiency, the enzyme that starts a specific reaction within the urea cycle is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so OTC deficiency causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver."

            "answer": "How is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency inherited? Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an X-linked disorder. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), mutations in both copies of the gene will cause the disorder. Some females with only one altered copy of the OTC gene also show signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency."

The signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Usually, accumulation of fatty tissue increases over time and may lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. The lipomas can cause physical deformity and peripheral neuropathy. In the majority of cases, the disease is benign; however, lipomas can become cancerous in rare circumstances. The exact cause of Madelung disease is unknown, but it may be associated with changes (mutations) in mitochondrial DNA and/or alcoholism.

            "answer": "What causes Madelung disease? The exact underlying cause of Madelung disease remains unknown, but several theories have been proposed. The body's inability to properly metabolize fat in affected people suggests that Madelung disease may be an endocrine disorder. An enzyme defect or a change in the surface of cells could prevent the breakdown of fat leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. Alcohol consumption may also play a role in the development of Madelung disease since roughly 90% of affected people have a history of alcohol abuse. Madelung disease has also been linked to genetic factors. Rarely, more than one family member can be affected by this condition which suggests that it may be inherited in at least some cases. In the majority of these families, the mode of inheritance has not been determined. However, changes (mutations) in mitochondrial DNA have been identified in some families who have Madelung disease in combination with other conditions that affect many different systems of the body."

Madelung disease is usually diagnosed based on a thorough physical exam, accurate medical history, and imaging studies - computed tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan). A CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the lipomas and surrounding tissues. Both of these tests are useful in establishing a diagnosis of Madelung disease, although MRI is often the preferred method.

            "answer": "How might Madelung disease be treated? To date, the most effective treatment for Madelung disease is surgery which may include surgical excision (removal) and/or liposuction. Liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring. It is also considered less invasive, technically easier, and better suited for people with a higher surgical or anaesthetic risk. Some researchers believe it is unnecessary to subject affected people to the risks of surgery because the condition is usually benign. In their opinion, surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities. The limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal of lipomas. The main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring; however, it offers the chance of more extensive \"debulking\" of affected areas. Reportedly, it is rarely possible to remove the lipomas completely and they often recur after both of these procedures. Some researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol, which increases the breakdown of fats. Abstaining from alcohol intake, weight loss, and correction of any associated metabolic/endocrine abnormalities are also recommended."

            "question": "What is (are) Familial avascular necrosis of the femoral head ?",
            "answer": "Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is a degenerative condition which causes the upper ends of the thigh bones (femurs) to break down due to an inadequate blood supply and deficient bone repair. It can lead to pain and limping and cause the legs to be of unequal length. The prevalence of ANFH is unknown but around 15,000 cases are reported each year in the United States, with most cases being associated with mechanical disruption (hip trauma or surgery), hypofibrinolysis (a reduced ability to dissolve clots), steroid use, smoking, alcohol intake, hemoglobinopathies and hyperlipidemia (an increase in the amount of fat - such as cholesterol and triglycerides - in the blood). Familial forms of ANFH appear to be very rare, with only a few families reported in the medical literature. Age of onset in these familial cases ranges from 15-48 years (as opposed to between 3rd to 5th decade of life for other forms of ANFH). Transmission in familial cases is autosomal dominant and mutations in the type II collagen gene (COL2A1) have been detected in affected family members."

This means that a person must have a change (mutation) in both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell to have Usher syndrome. One mutated copy is typically inherited from each parent, who are each referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier and not be affected."

The condition is almost always progressive (symptoms get worse over time), although alternating periods of sudden worsening with periods of no apparent progression are common. Early signs and symptoms may include loss of vision, crossed eyes (strabismus), and/or the development of a white mass in the pupil behind the lens of the eye (leukocoria). As the disease progresses, affected people may develop glaucoma; cataracts; reddish discoloration in the iris (rubeosis iridis or neovascular glaucoma); shrinking of the affected eyeball (phthisis bulbi); and/or swelling and irritation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis).

However, it is a reported feature of several different genetic syndromes, suggesting there may be a genetic component.[4716] Researchers believe that some cases of Coats disease may be due to somatic mutations in the NDP gene, which lead to deficient levels of a protein called norrin in the developing retina. A somatic mutation in this case is one that is acquired after conception (i.e. it was not inherited from a parent and cannot be passed on to an affected person's children)."

Eighty to 90% of affected people have no evidence of a genetic predisposition to the condition and no affected family members. Rarely, Coats disease can be inherited as a feature of several different genetic syndromes. For example, Coats disease has been reported in people with Senior-Loken syndrome and is a key symptom of a condition called Coats plus syndrome, which is characterized by Coats disease plus abnormalities of the brain, bones, gastrointestinal system, and other parts of the body. Both of these conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

            "answer": "Is genetic testing available for Coats disease? Genetic testing is not available for most cases of Coats disease. Eighty to 90% of affected people have no evidence of a genetic predisposition to the condition and no affected family members. Rarely, Coats disease can be inherited as a feature of several different genetic syndromes. For example, Coats disease has been reported in Senior-Loken syndrome, which is caused by changes (mutations) in one of several different genes, and Coats plus syndrome, which is caused by mutations in CTC1. Genetic testing is often an option for people affected by one of these conditions. How is Coats disease diagnosed? A diagnosis of Coats disease is often suspected based on the presense of characteristic signs and symptoms on thorough eye examination. Retinal fluorescein angiography, an imaging technique that uses a special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) are often performed to distinguish Coats disease from other conditions that affect the retina."

        {
            "question": "What are the treatments for Coats disease ?",
            "answer": "How might Coats disease be treated? The treatment of Coats disease depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Treatment is usually directed towards destroying affected blood vessels in the retina and salvaging as much vision as possible. A procedure that uses extreme cold to destroy abnormal blood vessels (cryotherapy), and/or a procedure that uses laser energy to heat and destroy abnormal tissue (photocoagulation) are often used singly or in combination. These procedures are typically used during the early stages of the disease along with steroids and other medications to control inflammation and leaking from blood vessels. More advanced cases may require surgical treatment. For example, surgery to reattach the retina may be necessary in cases of retinal detachment. Draining or surgically removing the fluids that fill the eyeball between the lens and the retina (vitrectomy) may also be used to treat Coats disease when retinal detachment is present."

People with AGAT deficiency generally have mild to moderate intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, delayed language development, muscle weakness, failure to thrive, autistic behaviors, and delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking, sitting). AGAT deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the GATM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment of AGAT deficiency is focused on increasing cerebral creatine levels and generally consists of supplementation with creatine monohydrate."

It has been described in 46 patients to date. Some people with this deletion have no observable features; while others have variable features that can include small head, developmental delay (speech and motor delays), mild intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and eye abnormalities. Other findings can include seizures as well as abnormalities of the heart, skeleton, and urinary system. Psychiatric and behavioral features can include autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep disorders. This syndrome is caused by a deletion in a specific region of 1q21.1, which is distinct from the deletion region that causes TAR syndrome."

Both are caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. Stickler syndrome type II, sometimes called the beaded vitreous type, is caused by mutations in the COL11A1 gene. Stickler syndrome type III, sometimes called the nonocular form, is caused by mutations in the COL11A2 gene. These forms of Stickler syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Stickler syndrome type IV is caused by mutations in the COL9A1 gene, and Stickler syndrome type V is caused by mutations in the COL9A2 gene.

            "question": "What is (are) Aspergillosis ?",
            "answer": "Aspergillosis is an infection, growth, or allergic response caused by the Aspergillus fungus. There are several different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of aspergillosis. This type of aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Aspergillosis ?",
            "answer": "How might aspergillosis be treated? If the infection is widespread or the person appears seriously ill, treatment is started immediately. Voriconazole is currently first-line treatment for invasive aspergillosis and is usually given intravenously. There are other antifungal drugs that can be used to treat invasive aspergillosis in patients who cannot take voriconazole or who have not responded to voriconazole. These include itraconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, caspofungin, micafungin, and posaconazole. Whenever possible, immunosuppressive medications should be discontinued or decreased. A fungus ball usually does not require treatment unless bleeding into the lung tissue is associated with the infection, then surgery is required. Antifungal agents do not help people with allergic aspergillosis. Allergic aspergillosis is treated with prednisone taken by mouth."

            "answer": "Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is the acute form of a skin condition called pityriasis lichenoides. Affected people generally develop a few to more than one hundred scaling papules which may become filled with blood and/or pus or erode into crusted red-brown spots. PLEVA generally resolves on its own within a few weeks to a few months; however, some people experience episodes of the condition on and off for years. Although PLEVA is diagnosed in people of all ages, it most commonly affects children and young adults. The exact underlying cause is unknown, but some scientists suspect that it may occur due to an exaggerated immune response or an overproduction of certain white blood cells (lymphoproliferative disorder). If treatment is necessary, recommended therapies may include oral antibiotic, sun exposure, topical steroids, immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize the immune system), phototherapy and/or systemic steroids."

Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is the acute form of a skin condition called pityriasis lichenoides. It is characterized by the sudden onset of red patches that quickly develop into scaling papules. These papules may become filled with blood and/or pus or erode into crusted red-brown spots. People may also experience burning and itching of the affected area. Scarring and/or temporary discoloration of the skin may be present after the lesions have healed. Although PLEVA can affect almost any part of the body, it most commonly develops on the trunk and/or limbs (arms/legs). Affected people may have a few to more than one hundred papules. The skin abnormalities generally resolve without treatment in a few weeks to a few months; however, some people experience episodes of the condition on and off for years. Aside from the skin findings, most affected people do not experience any additional signs and symptoms. However, some may experience fever, headaches, joint pain and swelling of nearby lymph nodes. Febrile Ulceronecrotic Mucha-Haberman Disease is a rare and severe variant of PLEVA that is associated with unique signs and symptoms. For more information on this condition, please click here."

            "question": "What causes Cleidocranial dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "What causes cleidocranial dysplasia? Cleidocranial dysplasia is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 (CBFA1) gene. The RUNX2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in bone and cartilage development and maintenance. Researchers believe that the RUNX2 protein acts as a \"master switch,\" regulating a number of other genes involved in the development of cells that build bones (osteoblasts). Some mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the RUNX2 protein. Other mutations result in an abnormally short protein. This shortage of functional RUNX2 protein interferes with normal bone and cartilage development, resulting in the signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia. In rare cases, affected individuals may experience additional, unusual symptoms resulting from the loss of other genes located near RUNX2. In about one-third of individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia, no mutation in the RUNX2 gene has been found. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.

Affected individuals typically require dental care due to various teeth abnormalities. People with cleidocranial dysplasia may receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D if their bone density is below normal, and preventive treatment for osteoporosis is usually started at a young age. Some affected individuals may need ear tubes if they have frequent ear infections.

            "answer": "Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia is a rare developmental disorder present from birth that affects the lungs. Infants with this condition have abnormally widened lymphatic vessels within the lungs. The lymphatic system, which helps the immune system protect the body against infection and disease, consists of a network of tubular channels that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph, which is made up of proteins, fats and certain white blood cells called lymphocytes, accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells. Infants with congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia often develop severe, potentially life-threatening, respiratory distress shortly after birth. They may also develop cyanosis, a condition caused by low levels of circulating oxygen in the blood which causes the skin to have a bluish tint. The exact cause of the condition is unknown. Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia can occur as a primary or secondary disorder. Primary congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia can occur as an isolated defect within the lungs or as part of a a generalized form of lymphatic vessel malformation that affects the entire body. Secondary congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia occurs secondary to another condition, often involving the heart."

This tumor most commonly affects children between 5 and 10 years of age; however, adults can sometimes be affected. Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct and/or Rathke cleft or from metaplasia (abnormal transformation of cells) of squamous epithelial cell remnants of the stomadeum.[orphanet] Craniopharyngioma is treated with surgery alone or by surgery followed by radiation."

Craniopharyngioma causes symptoms in three different ways: by increasing the pressure on the brain (intracranial pressure) by disrupting the function of the pituitary gland by damaging the optic nerve Increased pressure on the brain causes headache, nausea, vomiting (especially in the morning), and difficulty with balance. Damage to the pituitary gland causes hormone imbalances that can lead to excessive thirst and urination (diabetes insipidus) and stunted growth. When the optic nerve is damaged by the tumor, vision problems develop. These defects are often permanent, and may be worse after surgery to remove the tumor.

No standard care exists for RT although there are a lot of studies. Treatment includes resection of the tumor mass and chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors and rhabdoid tumors of the kidney have the same gene mutation and similar biopsy findings they are considered now identical or closely related entities. Also, 10-15% of patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors have brain tumors."

            "answer": "What causes Poland syndrome? The cause of Poland syndrome is unknown. Most evidence supports the idea that something abnormal happens during the sixth week of fetal development. This event most likely involves the vascular (blood and lymph) system. Speculations include: An interruption of the embryonic blood supply of the arteries that lie under the collarbone (subclavian arteries). This could be caused by the forward growth of the ribs reducing the flow of blood. A malformation of the subclavian arteries causes a reduced amount of blood delivered to the developing tissues on one side of the body."

            "answer": "How might Poland syndrome be treated? Management of Poland syndrome may include surgical correction of the chest wall deformities. Surgical options are available to improve appearance in both males and females. In females, breast reconstruction is typically performed at the time of normal full breast development and can be planned in conjunction with or following reconstruction of the chest wall. In males reconstruction of the chest may not be necessary if there is no underlying chest wall deformity. The optimal surgical approach will vary from patient to patient. Surgical options should be discussed with a surgeon familiar with reconstructive surgery in people with Poland syndrome."

People with this condition also have developmental delay and intellectual disability, usually ranging from moderate to severe. The signs and symptoms of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome overlap significantly with those of two other genetic conditions, Costello syndrome and Noonan syndrome. The three syndromes are part of a group of related conditions called the RASopathies and  they are distinguished by their genetic cause and specific patterns of signs and symptoms; however, it can be difficult to tell these conditions apart in infancy. The CFC syndroeme is caused by mutations in the BRAF (75%-80% of the cases), MAP2K1,  MAP2K2 or KRAS gene (in fewer than 5% of the cases). CFC syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition, however, most cases have resulted from new gene mutations and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Treatment is symptomatic and may include surgery to correct the heart problems."

            "answer": "Chromosome 16q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 16. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 16q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about 16q deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 16. To learn more about chromosomal anomalies please visit our GARD webpage on FAQs about Chromosome Disorders."

Some affected individuals have heart defects, kidney problems, and skeletal anomalies such as foot deformities. Typically their disposition is described as cheerful, sociable, and cooperative. The exact size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, but it contains at least six genes. This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell. The signs and symptoms of 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome are probably related to the loss of one or more genes in this region."

            "question": "What is (are) Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis ?",
            "answer": "Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a skin and blood vessel disorder that is present from birth. Common signs and symptoms include port wine stain and pigmentary lesions, such as melanocytic nevi or epidermal nevi. A variety of classification systems have been proposed for PPV, largely depending on what type of pigmentary lesion is present. Around half of individuals with PPV have systemic disease, meaning that body systems other than the skin are affected. Systemic symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. PPV is not inherited, but is thought to be caused by a genetic phenomenon called twin spotting."

            "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis? Characteristic signs and symptoms of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV), include port wine stain and pigmentary lesions. The port wine stain and pigmentary lesions are often extensive and can affect several areas of the body, including the face. Examples of associated pigmentary lesions, include: Melanocytic nevi  Epidermal nevi   In addition to the port wine stain and pigmentary lesions, other skin lesions are not uncommon, such as: Nevus anemicus  Cafe-au-lait spots Mongolian spots Nevus of Ota Nevus of Ito Nevus spilus Around half of people with PPV have systemic involvement (i.e., other body systems are affected). Eye conditions such as ocular melanosis (also called ocular melanocytosis) is common. Ocular melanosis refers to a blue-gray pigmentation in the 'white of the eye' or sclerae. This condition often occurs along with nevus of Ota and may affect one or both eyes. The complications of nevus of Ota are glaucoma and melanoma, as a result people with nevus of Ota require careful examination and follow-up by an opthamologist. Other eye conditions reported in PPV include iris hamartomas, iris mammillations, and iris nodules. Some individuals with PPV also have Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Sturge-Weber syndrome include a large port-wine stain facial birthmark, blood vessel abnormalities in the brain called leptomeningeal angiomas, as well as glaucoma, seizures, muscle weakness, paralysis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is characterized by a port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations. You can learn more about Sturge-Weber syndrome on our Web site at the following link: http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/7706/Sturge_Weber_syndrome.aspx You can learn more about Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome on the Genetic Home Reference Web site at the following link: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klippel-trenaunay-syndrome  A variety of other symptoms have been reported in individual cases of PPV (e.g., primary lymphedema, renal angiomas, moyamoya disease, scoliosis, malignant colonic polyposis, hypoplastic larynx, multiple granular cell tumors, and selective IgA deficiency). Conditions associated with PPV can vary greatly from person to person and can be difficult to predict."

            "answer": "What causes phacomatosis pigmentovascularis? Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is thought to occur as a result of a change in the arrangement of a small piece of genetic material in a developing embryo. Because of this change some of the baby's body cells carry two copies of recessive gene mutations while the majority of his or her body cells carry only one. Having two copies of the recessive gene mutations result in a diseased cell (and symptoms of PPV). This phenomenon is called twin spotting. PPV occurs by chance, it is not inherited, and affects only a subset of the body's cells. As a result risk to future offspring is very small."

Ketones are substances produced when fat cells break down and are an important source of energy, especially when there is a shortage of glucose. SCOT deficiency is characterized by intermittent ketoacidosis, with the first episode often occurring in newborns or infants (6 to 20 months). In ketoacidosis ketones build-up in the body. Symptoms of ketoacidosis may vary but can include trouble breathing, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, unconsciousness, and coma. Crises need to be addressed immediately. Fortunately these crises tend to respond well to IV fluids including glucose and sodium bicarbonate. Patients with SCOT defiency are symptom free between episodes.

Management includes surveillance for undiagnosed AVMs and treatment for identified complications such as nosebleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, pulmonary AVMs, cerebral AVMs, and hepatic AVMs. Treatment of nosebleeds with humidification and nasal lubricants, laser ablation, septal dermoplasty, or estrogen-progesterone therapy can prevent anemia and allow individuals with HHT to pursue normal activities. Individuals with GI bleeding are treated with iron therapy to maintain hemoglobin concentration; endoscopic application of a heater probe, bicap, or laser; surgical removal of bleeding sites; and estrogen-progesterone therapy. Iron replacement and red blood cell transfusions are used to treat anemia. Pulmonary AVMs with feeding vessels that exceed 3.0 mm in diameter require occlusion. Cerebral AVMs greater than 1.0 cm in diameter are treated by surgery, embolotherapy, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. The treatment of choice for hepatic AVMs is liver transplantation. Blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) and anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided. Some patients may need to take antibiotics during simple dental or surgical procedures. Individual patients and their doctors should make decisions regarding these measures, as necessary. Surveillance includes annual evaluations for anemia and neurologic conditions and re-evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every one to two years during childhood and every five years thereafter. Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary AVMs; if pulmonary AVMs are discovered during pregnancy, they are treated during the second trimester."

            "answer": "Is polycythemia vera inherited? Most cases of polycythemia vera (PCV) are not inherited from a parent and are acquired during a person's lifetime. The condition is associated with genetic changes (mutations) that are somatic, which means they occur in cells of the body but not in egg and sperm cells. In rare cases, the risk to develop PCV runs in families and sometimes appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that only one altered copy of a gene in each cell is enough to give a person an increased risk for PCV. In other words, while an increased risk to develop PCV may be inherited, the condition itself is not inherited."

No single treatment has been found to be effective for all affected individuals.  For mild cases, treatment may include avoiding triggers of itching and dry skin, or controlling the temperature of the environment and bathing water.  Several other treatments are available for more severe itching or for itching the does not respond to initial treatments.  Interferon-alpha has been found to be effective for reducing itching in a majority of individual with PV who received this therapy; however, this medication can have significant side effects.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), typically used to treat depression, may reducing itching for some individuals with PV..  Phototherapy, antihistamines, and phlebotomy have also been attempted, with mixed results.  Additionally, if a genetic cause of polycythemia vera is know, medications targeted to the causative gene - such as JAK or mTor inhibitors - may be helpful in reducing itching."

            "question": "What causes Liddle syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes Liddle syndrome? Liddle syndrome is caused by mutations (changes) in either of two genes: SCNN1B and SCNN1G . The SCNN1B gene provides instructions for making one piece (the beta subunit) of protein complexes called epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making a different piece (the gamma subunit) of ENaCs. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. Mutations in the SCNN1B and SCNN1G genes associated with Liddle syndrome affect an important region of the protein involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation). As a result of the mutations, the protein is not tagged for degradation, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell's surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium, which leads to hypertension. Removal of potassium from the blood is linked with reabsorption of sodium into the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia."

            "question": "What is (are) Familial stomach cancer ?",
            "answer": "Familial stomach cancer is a cluster of stomach cancer within a family. Most cases of stomach cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition; however, approximately 10% of stomach cancer is considered \"familial.\" Although the underlying cause of some familial cases is unknown, genetic changes (mutations) are identified in a subset of people affected by gastric cancer. Hereditary cancer syndromes associated with a predisposition to gastric cancer include hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. In other families, the cluster of stomach cancers may be due to a combination of gene(s) and/or other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. Depending on the estimated risk, high-risk cancer screening and/or prophylactic surgeries are typically recommended in people who have an increased risk for stomach cancer based on their personal and/or family histories."

The condition is thought to be multifactorial, which means that several factors likely interact to cause the condition. Factors that may contribute include genetic factors; teratogens (exposures during pregnancy that can harm a developing fetus) such as methimazole, carbimazole, misoprostol, and valproic acid; compromised vasculature to the skin; and trauma. Some cases may represent an incomplete or unusual form of a neural tube defect. Familial cases of aplasia cutis congenita have been reported.

            "answer": "How might aplasia cutis congenita be treated? The management of aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp is controversial.; both surgical and conservative treatment modalities have their proponents and opponents. The decision to use medical, surgical, or both forms of therapy in aplasia cutis congenita depends primarily on the size, depth, and location of the skin defect. Local therapy includes gentle cleansing and the application of bland ointment or silver sulfadiazine ointment to keep the area moist. Antibiotics may be utilized if overt signs of infection are noted. In many cases, other treatment is not necessary because the erosions and the ulcerations almost always heal on their own. Recently, a variety of specialized dressing materials have been developed and used. Surgical repair is not usually indicated if the defect is small. Recovery is generally uneventful, with gradual epithelialization and formation of a hairless, atrophic scar over several weeks. Small underlying bony defects usually close spontaneously during the first year of life. Surgical repair of large or multiple scalp defects may require excision with primary closure, if feasible, or the use of tissue expanders and rotation of a flap to fill the defect. On occasion, skin and bone grafts may also be required."

There are two types of lactate dehydrogenase deficiency: lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency (sometimes called glycogen storage disease XI) and lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. People with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). People with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency typically do not have symptoms. Lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency is caused by mutations in the LDHA gene. Lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency is caused by mutations in the LDHB gene. Both types are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

            "answer": "How might myoepithelial carcinoma be treated? The treatment for metastatic myoepithelial carcinoma usually begins with surgery to remove the main tumor.  Radiation therapy can be used to reduce the chance that the tumor could return in the same location.  Recent studies have shown that neutron-based radiation therapy may be more effective than proton-based radiation therapy for treating myoepithelial cancers. There is limited evidence about the usefulness of chemotherapy in treating metastatic myoepithelial cancer, and there are no standard treatment guidelines.  However, there are three reports of individuals with metastatic myoepithelial cancer who responded to chemotherapy.  In one individual, the metastatic tumors stopped growing during chemotherapy.  In the other two individuals, there was no evidence of the metastatic tumors after 14 months for one person and after three years for the other person."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Primary angiitis of the central nervous system ?",
            "answer": "How might primary angiitis of the central nervous system be treated?  The current treatment recommendation is to start with oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day. Most centers use prednisone and cyclophosphamide for 4-6 months to induce clinical remission, and then taper prednisone off. Patients generally stay on cyclophosphamide therapy between three and six months, depending on when remission occurs and if there are any potential side effects from cyclophosphamide. Once cyclophosphamide is discontinued, it should be replaced with a less toxic medication for an additional six to twelve months of maintenance therapy. Some doctors switch from cyclophosphamide to azathioprine (2 mg/kg) or mycophenolate mofetil. Methotrexate can also be used, but may be limited by its difficulty to cross the blood brain barrier. There is limited data on how long the maintenance therapy lasts so the decision on the duration of the therapy should be individualized, based upon how the patient responds to therapy."

Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus has also been linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported to develop in the presence of liver disease, cirrhosis, and inborn errors of metabolism. In addition, various other reported risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma include: male sex, co-infection with other viral liver disease, co-infection with HIV, alcohol abuse, family history of this carcinoma, increased hepatic iron, increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, exposure to aflatoxin B1 by food contamination, genetic variants of glutathione S-transferase, and various metabolic liver disorders.

If granulomas form in the lungs, symptoms may include shortness of breath (dyspnea), a cough that won't go away, and chest pain. Some people feel very tired, uneasy, or depressed. Night sweats and weight loss are also common.      Sarcoidosis can also cause the following:   Skin rashes, ulcers or discoloration   Joint stiffness or pain   Enlarged lymph nodes   Enlarged liver or spleen   Vision problems, eye dryness or irritation   Headaches, seizures, or weakness on one side of the face   Aches and pains in the muscles and bones   Abnormal heart beats   Kidney stones The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Sarcoidosis.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What causes Sarcoidosis ?",
            "answer": "What causes sarcoidosis? No one yet knows what causes sarcoidosis. It is thought by most scientists to be a disorder of the immune system, where the body's natural defense system malfunctions. Some physicians believe that sarcoidosis may result from a respiratory infection caused by a virus. Others suspect that exposure to toxins or allergens in the environment is to blame. It's also possible that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing sarcoidosis, which, when combined with an environmental trigger, produces the disease. Studies are ongoing to investigate the genetic and environmental components of this disease."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Sarcoidosis ?",
            "answer": "What treatment is available for sarcoidosis? The treatment of sarcoidosis depends on :  the symptoms present the severity of the symptoms whether any vital organs (e.g., your lungs, eyes, heart, or brain) are affected how the organ is affected. Some organs must be treated, regardless of your symptoms. Others may not need to be treated. Usually, if a patient doesn't have symptoms, he or she doesn't need treatment, and probably will recover in time. Currently, the drug that is most commonly used to treat sarcoidosis is prednisone.  When a patient's condition gets worse when taking prednisone or when the side effects of prednisone are severe in the patient, a doctor may prescribe other drugs. Most of these other drugs reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system. These other drugs include: hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Researchers continue to look for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs and antibiotics are currently being studied.

            "question": "What is (are) Leukodystrophy ?",
            "answer": "A leukodystrophy is a type of rare genetic disorder that affects the brain, spinal cord, and other nerves in the body. It is caused by destruction of the white matter of the brain. The white matter degrades due to defects of the myelin, which is a fatty covering that insulates nerves in the brain. Myelin is needed to protect the nerves and the nerves can't function normally without it. These disorders are progressive, meaning they tend to get worse with time. The leukodystrophies are a group of disorders caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in the genes involved in making myelin. Specific leukodystrophies include metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, and Alexander disease. The most common symptom of a leukodystrophy is a decline in functioning of an infant or child who previously appeared healthy. This gradual loss may be seen with issues in body tone, movements, gait, speech, ability to eat, vision, hearing, and behavior."

            "answer": "47, XYY syndrome is a condition in males characterized by features that occur due to having an extra copy of the Y chromosome in each cell. Signs and symptoms can vary and range from barely noticeable to more severe; many men with the extra Y chromosome are completely unaware of its presence. Appearance and intelligence are usually normal, but learning disabilities may be present. Other signs and symptoms may include autism spectrum disorder (usually on the milder end); speech or motor delay; low muscle tone; asthma; tall stature; impaired social skills; ADHD; and/or anxiety or mood disorders. While sexual development and infertility is usually normal, some adolescents and adults have testicular failure. 47, XYY syndrome usually is not inherited, occurring due to a random event in the formation of a sperm cell prior to conception. Management depends on the symptoms in each person and may include intervention or therapies for developmental delays, behavior or mood disorders; and/or special education."

            "question": "What causes 47, XYY syndrome ?",
            "answer": "What causes 47, XYY syndrome? 47,XYY syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male's cells. This is typically due to a random event during the formation of a sperm cell in the father, usually before conception (fertilization of the egg). In this case, the father's two Y chromosomes do not separate when sperm cells are being made. If two Y chromosomes are present in a sperm that fertilizes an egg (with an X chromosome), the resulting embryo will be a male with an extra Y chromosome. It is also possible that a similar random event could occur very early in an embryo's development. It is not fully understood why an extra copy of the Y chromosome leads to an increased risk for the features associated with 47, XYY syndrome in some males. Importantly, there is nothing either parent can do (or not do) to cause or prevent 47, XYY syndrome."

Recurrence of 47, XYY syndrome in a family is rare. The recurrence risk for siblings and other family members is not thought to be increased. Additionally, men with 47, XYY are not reported to have an increased risk for a child with a chromosome variation.

            "answer": "Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This condition affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, by preventing blood vessels from forming at the edges of the retina. This reduces the blood supply to retina. The signs and symptoms include vision loss or blindness, retinal detachment, strabismus, and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil. The severity of FEVR varies widely, even within the same family. Many people with this condition do not experience any vision problems.FEVR has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. Most individuals have the autosomal dominant form of this condition, caused by mutations in the FZD4 or LRP5 gene. FEVR caused by LRP5 gene mutations can also have an autosomal recessive inheritance. When this condition is caused by mutations in the NDP gene, it has an X-linked pattern of inheritance."

They tend to occur in the lower part of the spinal column and are usually considered to be benign, low-grade or grade I tumors. The age of diagnosis ranges from 6 to 82 years. Symptoms of an ependymoma are related to the location and size of the tumor and may include nausea, vomiting, headache, pain, numbness, bowel or bladder symptoms, and various other signs and symptoms. The cause of ependymomas is unknown. They are known to recur locally (more commonly in individuals diagnosed in childhood). Treatment may vary depending on the location, grade, and whether the tumor has spread to the spine, but typically includes aggressive surgery. Management may also include chemotherapy and radiation therapy."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Myxopapillary ependymoma ?",
            "answer": "How might myxopapillary ependymoma be treated? Standard treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma is surgery with the aim of removing as much of the tumor as possible. This tumor type may be cured if all of the tumor is removed during surgery, which is referred to as total resection, and there is usually a favorable outlook in these cases. However, surgery is typically less curative in tumors that are large, multifocal or extend outside the spinal cord. These tumors have the potential to regrow after the initial diagnosis and surgery (recur), particularly in individuals diagnosed as children. Following surgery, radiation therapy may be considered to destroy any cancer cells that could remain in the body.  The use of chemotherapy as another treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma remains controversial; chemotherapy has been widely used in pediatric individuals due to more aggressive disease. The usefulness of additional therapies following surgery is unclear for the subset of individuals with recurrence or in individuals in whom total resection cannot be achieved."

Doctors assess each patient individually to determine whether those with mild autoimmune hepatitis should undergo treatment. Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. With proper treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can usually be controlled. In fact, studies show that sustained response to treatment stops the disease from getting worse and may reverse some of the damage. The primary treatment is medicine to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Prednisone or other corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are drugs used to treat other autoimmune disorders, which have shown to help patients with autoimmune hepatitis as well. In about seven out of 10 people, the disease goes into remission within 3 years of starting treatment. Remission occurs when symptoms disappear and lab tests show improvement in liver function. Some people can eventually stop treatment, although many will see the disease return. People who stop treatment must carefully monitor their condition and promptly report any new symptoms to their doctor. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for years, if not for life. People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenylate mofetil, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. People who progress to end-stage liver diseasealso called liver failureor cirrhosis may need a liver transplant.

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

            "question": "What is (are) Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia characterized by lung inflammation and scarring that obstructs the small airways and air sacs of the lungs (alveoli). Signs and symptoms may include flu-like symptoms such as cough, fever, malaise, fatigue and weight loss. COP often affects adults in midlife (40 to 60 years of age). The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown (idiopathic). Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition but generally includes glucocorticoids."

            "question": "What causes Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "What causes cryptogenic organizing pneumonia? The underlying cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is unknown (idiopathic). Organizing pneumonia is specifically diagnosed as COP when, among other characteristics, no definite cause for the organizing pneumonia is found. In other words, any known cause for the pneumonia must be ruled out before stating that a person is affected by COP. Other forms of organizing pneumonia may result from infection (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi); drugs; or a reaction to radiation therapy for breast cancer. Organizing pneumonia can also be associated with specific disorders such as certain connective tissue disorders, blood malignancies (cancers), or ulcerative colitis."
