            "answer": "Some parents did not tell their children about receiving treatment with pituitary hGH and the possible risk of CJD. These children are now adults. Although the HHS no longer sends annual information about the problem of CJD in pituitary hGH recipients, the HHS does maintain a mailing list should any important new information become available. If parents are no longer available to receive HHS mailings, their adult children may not have access to important new information. Some pituitary hGH recipients have learned about the risk of CJD from newspaper stories. Others heard about it when they tried to give blood. Those who were not told by their parents are often angry when they hear about it outside the family. Any parent of an individual who received pituitary hGH who has not received any mailings from the HHSthe last correspondence was sent in June 1999should contact the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) with the adult child's current address. Knowledgeable staff members are glad to answer any questions that parents or recipients may have."

            "question": "What is (are) Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "Fecal incontinence, also called a bowel control problem, is the accidental passing of solid or liquid stool or mucus from the rectum. Fecal incontinence includes the inability to hold a bowel movement until reaching a toilet as well as passing stool into ones underwear without being aware of it happening. Stool, also called feces, is solid waste that is passed as a bowel movement and includes undigested food, bacteria, mucus, and dead cells. Mucus is a clear liquid that coats and protects tissues in the digestive system.\n                \nFecal incontinence can be upsetting and embarrassing. Many people with fecal incontinence feel ashamed and try to hide the problem. However, people with fecal incontinence should not be afraid or embarrassed to talk with their health care provider. Fecal incontinence is often caused by a medical problem and treatment is available."

            "question": "What is (are) Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestinewhich includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectumand anus. The intestines are sometimes called the bowel. The last part of the GI tractcalled the lower GI tractconsists of the large intestine and anus.\n                \nThe large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the last part of the coloncalled the sigmoid colonand the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement. During a bowel movement, stool moves from the rectum to the anus, the opening through which stool leaves the body."

        {
            "question": "What causes Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "Fecal incontinence has many causes, including\n                \n- diarrhea  - constipation  - muscle damage or weakness  - nerve damage  - loss of stretch in the rectum  - childbirth by vaginal delivery  - hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse  - rectocele  - inactivity\n                \nDiarrhea\n                \nDiarrhea can cause fecal incontinence. Loose stools fill the rectum quickly and are more difficult to hold than solid stools. Diarrhea increases the chance of not reaching a bathroom in time.\n                \nConstipation\n                \nConstipation can lead to large, hard stools that stretch the rectum and cause the internal sphincter muscles to relax by reflex. Watery stool builds up behind the hard stool and may leak out around the hard stool, leading to fecal incontinence.\n                \nThe type of constipation that is most likely to lead to fecal incontinence occurs when people are unable to relax their external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles when straining to have a bowel movement, often mistakenly squeezing these muscles instead of relaxing them. This squeezing makes it difficult to pass stool and may lead to a large amount of stool in the rectum. This type of constipation, called dyssynergic defecation or disordered defecation, is a result of faulty learning. For example, children or adults who have pain when having a bowel movement may unconsciously learn to squeeze their muscles to delay the bowel movement and avoid pain.\n                \nMuscle Damage or Weakness\n                \nInjury to one or both of the sphincter muscles can cause fecal incontinence. If these muscles, called the external and internal anal sphincter muscles, are damaged or weakened, they may not be strong enough to keep the anus closed and prevent stool from leaking.\n                \nTrauma, childbirth injuries, cancer surgery, and hemorrhoid surgery are possible causes of injury to the sphincters. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum.\n                \nNerve Damage\n                \nThe anal sphincter muscles wont open and close properly if the nerves that control them are damaged. Likewise, if the nerves that sense stool in the rectum are damaged, a person may not feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Both types of nerve damage can lead to fecal incontinence. Possible sources of nerve damage are childbirth; a long-term habit of straining to pass stool; spinal cord injury; and diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, that affect the nerves that go to the sphincter muscles and rectum. Brain injuries from stroke, head trauma, or certain diseases can also cause fecal incontinence.\n                \nLoss of Stretch in the Rectum\n                \nNormally, the rectum stretches to hold stool until a person has a bowel movement. Rectal surgery, radiation treatment, and inflammatory bowel diseaseschronic disorders that cause irritation and sores on the lining of the digestive systemcan cause the rectal walls to become stiff. The rectum then cant stretch as much to hold stool, increasing the risk of fecal incontinence.\n                \nChildbirth by Vaginal Delivery\n                \nChildbirth sometimes causes injuries to muscles and nerves in the pelvic floor. The risk is greater if forceps are used to help deliver the baby or if an episiotomya cut in the vaginal area to prevent the babys head from tearing the vagina during birthis performed. Fecal incontinence related to childbirth can appear soon after delivery or many years later.\n                \nHemorrhoids and Rectal Prolapse\n                \nExternal hemorrhoids, which develop under the skin around the anus, can prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing completely. Rectal prolapse, a condition that causes the rectum to drop down through the anus, can also prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing well enough to prevent leakage. Small amounts of mucus or liquid stool can then leak through the anus.\n                \nRectocele\n                \nRectocele is a condition that causes the rectum to protrude through the vagina. Rectocele can happen when the thin layer of muscles separating the rectum from the vagina becomes weak. For women with rectocele, straining to have a bowel movement may be less effective because rectocele reduces the amount of downward force through the anus. The result may be retention of stool in the rectum. More research is needed to be sure rectocele increases the risk of fecal incontinence.\n                \nInactivity\n                \nPeople who are inactive, especially those who spend many hours a day sitting or lying down, have an increased risk of retaining a large amount of stool in the rectum. Liquid stool can then leak around the more solid stool. Frail, older adults are most likely to develop constipation-related fecal incontinence for this reason."

            "question": "How to diagnose Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "Health care providers diagnose fecal incontinence based on a persons medical history, physical exam, and medical test results. In addition to a general medical history, the health care provider may ask the following questions:\n                \n- When did fecal incontinence start?  - How often does fecal incontinence occur?  - How much stool leaks? Does the stool just streak the underwear? Does just a little bit of solid or liquid stool leak out or does complete loss of bowel control occur?  - Does fecal incontinence involve a strong urge to have a bowel movement or does it happen without warning?  - For people with hemorrhoids, do hemorrhoids bulge through the anus? Do the hemorrhoids pull back in by themselves, or do they have to be pushed in with a finger?  - How does fecal incontinence affect daily life?  - Is fecal incontinence worse after eating? Do certain foods seem to make fecal incontinence worse?  - Can passing gas be controlled?\n                \nPeople may want to keep a stool diary for several weeks before their appointment so they can answer these questions. A stool diary is a chart for recording daily bowel movement details. A sample stool diary is available on the Bowel Control Awareness Campaign website at www.bowelcontrol.nih.gov.\n                \nThe person may be referred to a doctor who specializes in problems of the digestive system, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist, or colorectal surgeon, or a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as a urologist or urogynecologist. The specialist will perform a physical exam and may suggest one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- anal manometry  - anal ultrasound  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  - defecography  - flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy  - anal electromyography (EMG)\n                \nAnal manometry. Anal manometry uses pressure sensors and a balloon that can be inflated in the rectum to check the sensitivity and function of the rectum. Anal manometry also checks the tightness of the anal sphincter muscles around the anus. To prepare for this test, the person should use an enema and not eat anything 2 hours before the test. An enema involves flushing water or a laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. For this test, a thin tube with a balloon on its tip and pressure sensors below the balloon is inserted into the anus until the balloon is in the rectum and pressure sensors are located in the anal canal. The tube is slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. No anesthesia is needed for this test, which takes about 30 minutes.\n                \nAnal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An anal ultrasound is specific to the anus and rectum. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the structure of the anal sphincter muscles.\n                \nMRI. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confined spaces may be given medication to help them relax. An MRI may include the injection of special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. MRIs can show problems with the anal sphincter muscles. MRI is an alternative to anal ultrasound that may provide more detailed information, especially about the external anal sphincter.\n                \nDefecography. This x ray of the area around the anus and rectum shows how well the person can hold and evacuate stool. The test also identifies structural changes in the rectum and anus such as rectocele and rectal prolapse. To prepare for the test, the person uses two enemas and does not eat anything 2 hours prior to the test. During the test, the health care provider fills the rectum with a soft paste that shows up on x rays and is the same consistency as stool. The person sits on a toilet inside an x-ray machine. The person is first asked to pull in and squeeze the sphincter muscles to prevent leakage and then to strain as if having a bowel movement. The radiologist studies the x rays to identify problems with the rectum, anus, and pelvic floor muscles.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These tests are used to help diagnose problems causing fecal incontinence. The tests are similar, but colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. For both tests, a health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test. A laxative may be required the night before the test. One or more enemas may be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.\n                \nIn most cases, people will be given light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, to help them relax during flexible sigmoidoscopy. Anesthesia is used for colonoscopy. For either test, the person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show problems in the lower GI tract that may be causing the bowel control problem. The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue from the bowel lining for examination with a microscope.\n                \nThe person will not feel the biopsy. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab to confirm the diagnosis.\n                \nCramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. Driving is not permitted for 24 hours after flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to allow the anesthesia time to wear off. Before the appointment, a person should make plans for a ride home. Full recovery is expected by the next day and the person is able to go back to a normal diet.\n                \nAnal EMG. Anal EMG checks the health of the pelvic floor muscles and the nerves that control the muscles. The health care provider inserts a very thin needle electrode through the skin into the muscle. The electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by the muscles and shows it as images on a monitor or sounds through a speaker. An alternative type of anal EMG uses stainless steel plates attached to the sides of a plastic plug instead of a needle. The plug is inserted into the anal canal to measure the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter and other pelvic floor muscles. The average amount of electrical activity when the person relaxes quietly, squeezes to prevent a bowel movement, and strains to have a bowel movement shows whether there is damage to the nerves that control the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles."

            "question": "What to do for Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "Dietary changes that may improve fecal incontinence include\n                \n- Eating the right amount of fiber. Fiber can help with diarrhea and constipation. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Fiber supplements sold in a pharmacy or in a health food store are another common source of fiber to treat fecal incontinence. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day for adults and age plus five grams for children. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get 7 plus five, or 12, grams of fiber a day. American adults consume only 15 grams a day on average.2 Fiber should be added to the diet slowly to avoid bloating.  - Getting plenty to drink. Drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of liquid a day may help prevent constipation. Water is a good choice. Drinks with caffeine, alcohol, milk, or carbonation should be avoided if they trigger diarrhea.\n                \nKeeping a Food Diary   A food diary can help identify foods that cause diarrhea and increase the risk of fecal incontinence. A food diary should list foods eaten, portion size, and when fecal incontinence occurs. After a few days, the diary may show a link between certain foods and fecal incontinence. Eating less of foods linked to fecal incontinence may improve symptoms. A food diary can also be helpful to a health care provider treating a person with fecal incontinence.   Common foods and drinks linked to fecal incontinence include   - dairy products such as milk, cheese, and ice cream   - drinks and foods containing caffeine   - cured or smoked meat such as sausage, ham, and turkey   - spicy foods   - alcoholic beverages   - fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears   - fatty and greasy foods   - sweeteners in diet drinks and sugarless gum and candy, including sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and fructose\n                \n\n                \nExamples of Foods That Have Fiber        Beans, cereals, and breads    Fiber         cup of beans (navy, pinto, kidney, etc.), cooked    6.29.6 grams         cup of shredded wheat, ready-to-eat cereal    2.73.8 grams         cup of 100% bran, ready-to-eat cereal    9.1 grams        1 small oat bran muffin    3.0 grams        1 whole-wheat English muffin    4.4 grams        Fruits        1 small apple, with skin    3.6 grams        1 medium pear, with skin    5.5 grams         cup of raspberries    4.0 grams         cup of stewed prunes    3.8 grams        Vegetables         cup of winter squash, cooked    2.9 grams         1 medium sweet potato, baked in skin    3.8 grams         cup of green peas, cooked    3.54.4 grams        1 small potato, baked, with skin    3.0 grams         cup of mixed vegetables, cooked    4.0 grams         cup of broccoli, cooked    2.62.8 grams          cup of greens (spinach, collards, turnip greens), cooked    2.53.5 grams\n                \n\n                \nMedications\n                \nIf diarrhea is causing fecal incontinence, medication may help. Health care providers sometimes recommend using bulk laxatives, such as Citrucel and Metamucil, to develop more solid stools that are easier to control. Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be recommended to slow down the bowels and help control the problem.\n                \nBowel Training\n                \nDeveloping a regular bowel movement pattern can improve fecal incontinence, especially fecal incontinence due to constipation. Bowel training involves trying to have bowel movements at specific times of the day, such as after every meal. Over time, the body becomes used to a regular bowel movement pattern, thus reducing constipation and related fecal incontinence. Persistence is key to successful bowel training. Achieving a regular bowel control pattern can take weeks to months.\n                \nPelvic Floor Exercises and Biofeedback\n                \nExercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve bowel control. Pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing and relaxing pelvic floor muscles 50 to 100 times a day. A health care provider can help with proper technique. Biofeedback therapy may also help a person perform the exercises properly. This therapy also improves a persons awareness of sensations in the rectum, teaching how to coordinate squeezing of the external sphincter muscle with the sensation of rectal filling. Biofeedback training uses special sensors to measure bodily functions. Sensors include pressure or EMG sensors in the anus, pressure sensors in the rectum, and a balloon in the rectum to produce graded sensations of rectal fullness. The measurements are displayed on a video screen as sounds or line graphs. The health care provider uses the information to help the person modify or change abnormal function. The person practices the exercises at home. Success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of fecal incontinence, its severity, and the persons motivation and ability to follow the health care providers recommendations.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery may be an option for fecal incontinence that fails to improve with other treatments or for fecal incontinence caused by pelvic floor or anal sphincter muscle injuries.\n                \n- Sphincteroplasty, the most common fecal incontinence surgery, reconnects the separated ends of a sphincter muscle torn by childbirth or another injury. Sphincteroplasty is performed at a hospital by a colorectal, gynecological, or general surgeon.  - Artificial anal sphincter involves placing an inflatable cuff around the anus and implanting a small pump beneath the skin that the person activates to inflate or deflate the cuff. This surgery is much less common and is performed at a hospital by a specially trained colorectal surgeon.  - Nonabsorbable bulking agents can be injected into the wall of the anus to bulk up the tissue around the anus. The bulkier tissues make the opening of the anus narrower so the sphincters are able to close better. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. The person can return to normal physical activities 1 week after the procedure.  - Bowel diversion is an operation that reroutes the normal movement of stool out of the body when part of the bowel is removed. The operation diverts the lower part of the small intestine or colon to an opening in the wall of the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips. An external pouch is attached to the opening to collect stool. The procedure is performed by a surgeon in a hospital and anesthesia is used. More information about these procedures can be found in the Bowel Diversion fact sheet.\n                \nElectrical Stimulation\n                \nElectrical stimulation, also called sacral nerve stimulation or neuromodulation, involves placing electrodes in the sacral nerves to the anus and rectum and continuously stimulating the nerves with electrical pulses. The sacral nerves connect to the part of the spine in the hip area. A battery-operated stimulator is placed beneath the skin. Based on the persons response, the health care provider can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that person. The person can turn the stimulator on or off at any time. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center using local anesthesia."

            "question": "What is (are) Fecal Incontinence ?",
            "answer": "Fecal incontinence can cause embarrassment, fear, and loneliness. Taking steps to cope is important. The following tips can help:\n                \n- carrying a bag with cleanup supplies and a change of clothes when leaving the house.  - finding public restrooms before one is needed.  - using the toilet before leaving home.  - wearing disposable underwear or absorbent pads inserted in the underwear.  - using fecal deodorantspills that reduce the smell of stool and gas. Although fecal deodorants are available over the counter, a health care provider can help people find them.\n                \nEating tends to trigger contractions of the large intestine that push stool toward the rectum and also cause the rectum to contract for 30 to 60 minutes. Both these events increase the likelihood that a person will pass gas and have a bowel movement soon after eating. This activity may increase if the person is anxious. People with fecal incontinence may want to avoid eating in restaurants or at social gatherings, or they may want to take antidiarrheal medications before eating in these situations.\n                \nAnal Discomfort   The skin around the anus is delicate and sensitive. Constipation and diarrhea or contact between skin and stool can cause pain or itching. The following steps can help relieve anal discomfort:   - Washing the anal area after a bowel movement. Washing with water, but not soap, can help prevent discomfort. Soap can dry out the skin, making discomfort worse. Ideally, the anal area should be washed in the shower with lukewarm water or in a sitz batha special plastic tub that allows a person to sit in a few inches of warm water. No-rinse skin cleansers, such as Cavilon, are a good alternative. Wiping with toilet paper further irritates the skin and should be avoided. Premoistened, alcohol-free towelettes are a better choice.   - Keeping the anal area dry. The anal area should be allowed to air dry after washing. If time doesnt permit air drying, the anal area can be gently patted dry with a lint-free cloth.   - Creating a moisture barrier. A moisture barrier cream that contains ingredients such as dimethiconea type of siliconecan help form a barrier between skin and stool. The anal area should be cleaned before applying barrier cream. However, people should talk with their health care provider before using anal creams and ointments because some can irritate the anus.   - Using nonmedicated powders. Nonmedicated talcum powder or cornstarch can also relieve anal discomfort. As with moisture barrier creams, the anal area should be clean and dry before use.   - Using wicking pads or disposable underwear. Pads and disposable underwear with a wicking layer can pull moisture away from the skin.   - Wearing breathable clothes and underwear. Clothes and underwear should allow air to flow and keep skin dry. Tight clothes or plastic or rubber underwear that blocks air can worsen skin problems.   - Changing soiled underwear as soon as possible."

            "answer": "Bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis) is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.\n                \nBronchiectasis usually is the result of an infection or other condition that injures the walls of your airways or prevents the airways from clearing mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance that the airways produce to help remove inhaled dust, bacteria, and other small particles.\n                \nIn bronchiectasis, your airways slowly lose their ability to clear out mucus. When mucus can't be cleared, it builds up and creates an environment in which bacteria can grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections.\n                \nEach infection causes more damage to your airways. Over time, the airways lose their ability to move air in and out. This can prevent enough oxygen from reaching your vital organs.\n                \nBronchiectasis can lead to serious health problems, such as respiratory failure, atelectasis (at-eh-LEK-tah-sis), and heart failure.\n                \nBronchiectasis\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nBronchiectasis can affect just one section of one of your lungs or many sections of both lungs.\n                \nThe initial lung damage that leads to bronchiectasis often begins in childhood. However, symptoms may not occur until months or even years after you start having repeated lung infections.\n                \nIn the United States, common childhood infectionssuch as whooping cough and measlesused to cause many cases of bronchiectasis. However, these causes are now less common because of vaccines and antibiotics.\n                \nNow bronchiectasis usually is due to a medical condition that injures the airway walls or prevents the airways from clearing mucus. Examples of such conditions include cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary (SIL-e-ar-e) dyskinesia (dis-kih-NE-ze-ah), or PCD.\n                \nBronchiectasis that affects only one part of the lung may be caused by a blockage rather than a medical condition.\n                \nBronchiectasis can be congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) or acquired. Congenital bronchiectasis affects infants and children. It's the result of a problem with how the lungs form in a fetus.\n                \nAcquired bronchiectasis occurs as a result of another condition or factor. This type of bronchiectasis can affect adults and older children. Acquired bronchiectasis is more common than the congenital type.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nCurrently, bronchiectasis has no cure. However, with proper care, most people who have it can enjoy a good quality of life.\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis are important. The sooner your doctor starts treating bronchiectasis and any underlying conditions, the better your chances of preventing further lung damage."

Examples of such conditions include:\n                \nCystic fibrosis. This disease leads to almost half of the cases of bronchiectasis in the United States.\n                \nImmunodeficiency disorders, such as common variable immunodeficiency and, less often, HIV and AIDS.\n                \nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (AS-per-ji-LO-sis). This is an allergic reaction to a fungus called aspergillus. The reaction causes swelling in the airways.\n                \nDisorders that affect cilia (SIL-e-ah) function, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia are small, hair-like structures that line your airways. They help clear mucus (a slimy substance) out of your airways.\n                \nChronic (ongoing) pulmonary aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun). This is a condition in which you inhale food, liquids, saliva, or vomited stomach contents into your lungs. Aspiration can inflame the airways, which can lead to bronchiectasis.\n                \nConnective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgrens syndrome, and Crohns disease.\n                \nOther conditions, such as an airway blockage, also can lead to bronchiectasis. Many things can cause a blockage, such as a growth or a noncancerous tumor. An inhaled object, such as a piece of a toy or a peanut that you inhaled as a child, also can cause an airway blockage.\n                \nA problem with how the lungs form in a fetus may cause congenital bronchiectasis.

The condition also can occur if your lungs can't properly remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood.\n                \nRespiratory failure can cause shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and air hunger (feeling like you can't breathe in enough air). In severe cases, signs and symptoms may include a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails; confusion; and sleepiness.\n                \nAtelectasis is a condition in which one or more areas of your lungs collapse or don't inflate properly. As a result, you may feel short of breath. Your heart rate and breathing rate may increase, and your skin and lips may turn blue.\n                \nIf bronchiectasis is so advanced that it affects all parts of your airways, it may cause heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing, tiredness, and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck."

These tests can show whether you have an underlying condition that can lead to bronchiectasis. Blood tests also can show whether you have an infection or low levels of certain infection-fighting blood cells.\n                \nA sputum culture. Lab tests can show whether a sample of your sputum contains bacteria (such as the bacteria that cause tuberculosis) or fungi.\n                \nLung function tests.

Doctors use this procedure to look inside the airways.\n                \nDuring bronchoscopy, a flexible tube with a light on the end is inserted through your nose or mouth into your airways. The tube is called a bronchoscope. It provides a video image of your airways. You'll be given medicine to numb your upper airway and help you relax during the procedure.\n                \nBronchoscopy can show whether you have a blockage in your airways.

Oral antibiotics often are used to treat these infections.\n                \nFor hard-to-treat infections, your doctor may prescribe intravenous (IV) antibiotics. These medicines are given through an IV line inserted into your arm. Your doctor may help you arrange for a home care provider to give you IV antibiotics at home.\n                \nExpectorants and Mucus-Thinning Medicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe expectorants and mucus thinners to help you cough up mucus.\n                \nExpectorants help loosen the mucus in your lungs. They often are combined with decongestants, which may provide extra relief. Mucus thinners, such as acetylcysteine, loosen the mucus to make it easier to cough up.\n                \nFor some of these treatments, little information is available to show how well they work.\n                \nHydration\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluid, especially water, helps prevent airway mucus from becoming thick and sticky. Good hydration helps keep airway mucus moist and slippery, which makes it easier to cough up.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called physiotherapy (FIZ-e-o-THER-ah-pe) or chest clapping or percussion. This technique is generally performed by a respiratory therapist but can be done by a trained member of the family. It involves the therapist pounding your chest and back over and over with his or her hands or a device. Doing this helps loosen the mucus from your lungs so you can cough it up.\n                \nYou can sit with your head tilted down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices can help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency air waves to force mucus toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small handheld device that you breathe out through. It causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations to help break loose mucus from your airway walls.\n                \nSome of these methods and devices are popular with patients and doctors, but little information is available on how well they actually work. Choice usually is based on convenience and cost.\n                \nSeveral breathing techniques also are used to help move mucus to the upper airway so it can be coughed up. These techniques include forced expiration technique (FET) and active cycle breathing (ACB).\n                \nFET involves forcing out a couple of breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. ACB is FET that involves deep breathing exercises.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nDepending on your condition, your doctor also may recommend bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, oxygen therapy, or surgery.\n                \nBronchodilators\n                \nBronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are inhaled medicines. You will use an inhaler or a nebulizer to breathe in a fine mist of medicine.\n                \nInhaled bronchodilators work quickly because the medicine goes straight to your lungs. Your doctor may recommend that you use a bronchodilator right before you do CPT.\n                \nInhaled Corticosteroids\n                \nIf you also have wheezing or asthma with your bronchiectasis, your doctor may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation in the airways).\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nOxygen therapy can help raise low blood oxygen levels. For this treatment, you'll receive oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy can be done at home, in a hospital, or in another health facility. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.)\n                \nSurgery\n                \nYour doctor may recommend surgery if no other treatments have helped and only one part of your airway is affected. If you have major bleeding in your airway, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove part of your airway or a procedure to control the bleeding.\n                \nIn very rare instances of severe bronchiectasis, your doctor may recommend that you receive a lung transplant replacing your diseased lungs with a healthy set of lungs."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nHigh blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures.\n                \nMeasuring Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, sometimes called hypertension, happens when this force is too high. Health care workers check blood pressure readings the same way for children, teens, and adults. They use a gauge, stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. With this equipment, they measure:\n                \nSystolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood\n                \nDiastolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats\n                \nHealth care workers write blood pressure numbers with the systolic number above the diastolic number. For example:\n                \n\n                \n118/76 mmHg People read \"118 over 76\" millimeters of mercury.\n                \nNormal Blood Pressure\n                \nNormal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range.\n                \nBlood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults.\n                \nAbnormal Blood Pressure\n                \nAbnormal increases in blood pressure are defined as having blood pressures higher than 120/80 mmHg. The following table outlines and defines high blood pressure severity levels.\n                \nStages of High Blood Pressure in Adults\n                \nThe ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.\n                \nAlthough blood pressure increases seen in prehypertension are less than those used to diagnose high blood pressure, prehypertension can progress to high blood pressure and should be taken seriously. Over time, consistently high blood pressure weakens and damages your blood vessels, which can lead to complications.\n                \nTypes of High Blood Pressure\n                \nThere are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.\n                \nPrimary High Blood Pressure\n                \nPrimary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.\n                \nSecondary High Blood Pressure\n                \nSecondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines.

            "answer": "Changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function.\n                \nBiology and High Blood Pressure\n                \nResearchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include:\n                \nKidney fluid and salt balances\n                \nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n                \nSympathetic nervous system activity\n                \nBlood vessel structure and function\n                \n\n                \nKidney Fluid and Salt Balances\n                \nThe kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\n                \nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nSympathetic Nervous System Activity\n                \nThe sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nBlood Vessel Structure and Function\n                \nChanges in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Causes of High Blood Pressure\n                \nMuch of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life.\n                \nEnvironmental Causes of High Blood Pressure\n                \nEnvironmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines.\n                \n\n                \nUnhealthy Lifestyle Habits\n                \nUnhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including:\n                \nHigh dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity\n                \nDrinking excess amounts of alcohol\n                \nLack of physical activity\n                \n\n                \nOverweight and Obesity\n                \nResearch studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nPrescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure.\n                \nOther Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure\n                \nOther medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure."

            "question": "Who is at risk for High Blood Pressure? ?",
            "answer": "Anyone can develop high blood pressure; however, age, race or ethnicity, being overweight, gender, lifestyle habits, and a family history of high blood pressure can increase your risk for developing high blood pressure.\n                \nAge\n                \nBlood pressure tends to rise with age. About 65 percent of Americans age 60 or older have high blood pressure. However, the risk for prehypertension and high blood pressure is increasing for children and teens, possibly due to the rise in the number of overweight children and teens.\n                \nRace/Ethnicity\n                \nHigh blood pressure is more common in African American adults than in Caucasian or Hispanic American adults. Compared with these ethnic groups, African Americans:\n                \nTend to get high blood pressure earlier in life.\n                \nOften, on average, have higher blood pressure numbers.\n                \nAre less likely to achieve target blood pressure goals with treatment.\n                \nOverweight\n                \nYou are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressure if youre overweight or obese. The terms overweight and obese refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nGender\n                \nBefore age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure.\n                \nLifestyle Habits\n                \nUnhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, and they include:\n                \nEating too much sodium or too little potassium\n                \nLack of physical activity\n                \nDrinking too much alcohol\n                \nStress\n                \nFamily History\n                \nA family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressure. Some people have a high sensitivity to sodium and salt, which may increase their risk for high blood pressure and may run in families. Genetic causes of this condition are why family history is a risk factor for this condition."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of High Blood Pressure ?",
            "answer": "Because diagnosis is based on blood pressure readings, this condition can go undetected for years, as symptoms do not usually appear until the body is damaged from chronic high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nComplications of High Blood Pressure\n                \nWhen blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage the body and cause complications. Some common complications and their signs and symptoms include:\n                \nAneurysms:When an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery. Aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow. The signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm.\n                \nChronic Kidney Disease: When blood vessels narrow in the kidneys, possibly causing kidney failure.\n                \nCognitive Changes: Research shows that over time, higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms include memory loss, difficulty finding words, and losing focus during conversations.\n                \nEye Damage: When blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed. Signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness.\n                \nHeart Attack: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen. The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort, and shortness of breath.\n                \nHeart Failure: When the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. Common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling tired; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.\n                \nPeripheral Artery Disease: A disease in which plaque builds up in leg arteries and affects blood flow in the legs. When people have symptoms, the most common are pain, cramping, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the legs, feet, and buttocks after walking or climbing stairs.\n                \nStroke: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden onset of weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs; trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing."

            "question": "How to diagnose High Blood Pressure ?",
            "answer": "For most patients, health care providers diagnose high blood pressure when blood pressure readings areconsistently 140/90 mmHg or above.\n                \nConfirming High Blood Pressure\n                \nA blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic. To prepare for the test:\n                \nDont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test.\n                \nGo to the bathroom before the test.\n                \nSit for 5 minutes before the test.\n                \nTo track blood pressure readings over a period of time, the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure. The health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results.\n                \nWhenever you have an appointment with the health care provider, be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings. Every time you visit the health care provider, he or she should tell you what your blood pressure numbers are; if he or she does not, you should ask for your readings.\n                \nBlood Pressure Severity and Type\n                \nYour health care provider usually takes 23 readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure. Using the results of your blood pressure test, your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if:\n                \nYour systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mmHg.\n                \nYour childs blood pressure numbers are outside average numbers for children of the same age, gender, and height.\n                \nOnce your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure, he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure. Health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan.\n                \nSome people have white coat hypertension. This happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location. Health care providers diagnose this type of high blood pressure by reviewing readings in the office and readings taken anywhere else. Researchers believe stress, which can occur during the medical appointment, causes white coat hypertension."

            "question": "What are the treatments for High Blood Pressure ?",
            "answer": "Based on your diagnosis, health care providers develop treatment plans for high blood pressure that include lifelong lifestyle changes and medicines to control high blood pressure; lifestyle changes such as weight loss can be highly effective in treating high blood pressure.\n                \n\n                \nTreatment Plans\n                \nHealth care providers work with you to develop a treatment plan based on whether you were diagnosed with primary or secondary high blood pressure and if there is a suspected or known cause. Treatment plans may evolve until blood pressure control is achieved.\n                \nIf your health care provider diagnoses you with secondary high blood pressure, he or she will work to treat the other condition or change the medicine suspected of causing your high blood pressure. If high blood pressure persists or is first diagnosed as primary high blood pressure, your treatment plan will include lifestyle changes. When lifestyle changes alone do not control or lower blood pressure, your health care provider may change or update your treatment plan by prescribing medicines to treat the disease. Health care providers prescribe children and teens medicines at special doses that are safe and effective in children.\n                \nIf your health care provider prescribes medicines as a part of your treatment plan, keep up your healthy lifestyle habits. The combination of the medicines and the healthy lifestyle habits helps control and lower your high blood pressure.\n                \nSome people develop resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure. This can happen when the medications they are taking do not work well for them or another medical condition is leading to uncontrolled blood pressure. Health care providers treat resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure with an intensive treatment plan that can include a different set of blood pressure medications or other special treatments.\n                \nTo achieve the best control of your blood pressure, follow your treatment plan and take all medications as prescribed. Following your prescribed treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay complications that high blood pressure can cause and can lower your risk for other related problems.\n                \n\n                \nHealthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nHealthy lifestyle habits can help you control high blood pressure. These habits include:\n                \nHealthy eating\n                \nBeing physically active\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nLimiting alcohol intake\n                \nManaging and coping with stress\n                \nTo help make lifelong lifestyle changes, try making one healthy lifestyle change at a time and add another change when you feel that you have successfully adopted the earlier changes. When you practice several healthy lifestyle habits, you are more likely to lower your blood pressure and maintain normal blood pressure readings.\n                \n\n                \nHealthy Eating\n                \nTo help treat high blood pressure, health care providers recommend that you limit sodium and salt intake, increase potassium, and eat foods that are heart healthy.\n                \nLimiting Sodium and Salt\n                \nA low-sodium diet can help you manage your blood pressure. You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 mg sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nYour health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about the DASH eating plan.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour health care provider also may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nWhole grains\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nIn the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, which studied Hispanics living in the United States, Cubans ate more sodium and Mexicans ate less sodium than other Hispanic groups in the study. All Hispanic Americans should follow these healthy eating recommendations even when cooking traditional Latino dishes. Try some of these popular Hispanic American heart-healthy recipes.\n                \n\n                \nBeing Physically Active\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services'2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 to 5 percent can lower your risk for health problems. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lowerLDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. However, research shows that no matter your weight, it is important to control high blood pressure to maintain good health.\n                \nA useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI measures your weight in relation to your height. To figure out your BMI, check out NHLBIs online BMI calculator or talk to yourhealth care provider.\n                \nA BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to Aim for a Healthy Weight.\n                \n\n                \nLimiting Alcohol Intake\n                \nLimit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nManaging and Coping With Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health and can lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include:\n                \nBeing physically active\n                \nListening to music or focusing on something calm or peaceful\n                \nPerforming yoga or tai chi\n                \nMeditating\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nBlood pressure medicines work in different ways to stop or slow some of the bodys functions that cause high blood pressure. Medicines to lower blood pressure include:\n                \nDiuretics (Water or Fluid Pills): Flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.\n                \nBeta Blockers: Help your heart beat slower and with less force. As a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure.\n                \nAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.\n                \nAngiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.\n                \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure.\n                \nAlpha Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.\n                \nAlpha-Beta Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. However, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.\n                \nCentral Acting Agents: Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.\n                \nVasodilators: Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.\n                \nTo lower and control blood pressure, many people take two or more medicines. If you have side effects from your medicines, dont stop taking your medicines. Instead, talk with your health care provider about the side effects to see if the dose can be changed or a new medicine prescribed.\n                \nFuture Treatments\n                \nScientists, doctors, and researchers continue to study the changes that cause high blood pressure, to develop new medicines and treatments to control high blood pressure. Possible future treatments under investigation include new combination medicines, vaccines, and interventions aimed at the sympathetic nervous system, such as kidney nerve ablation."

            "question": "What is (are) Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?",
            "answer": "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart problem that occurs soon after birth in some babies. In PDA, abnormal blood flow occurs between two of the major arteries connected to the heart.\n                \nBefore birth, the two major arteriesthe aorta and the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) arteryare connected by a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus. This vessel is an essential part of fetal blood circulation.\n                \nWithin minutes or up to a few days after birth, the vessel is supposed to close as part of the normal changes occurring in the baby's circulation.\n                \nIn some babies, however, the ductus arteriosus remains open (patent). This opening allows oxygen-rich blood from the aorta to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the pulmonary artery. This can put strain on the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.\n                \nNormal Heart and Heart With Patent Ductus Arteriosus\n                \n\n                \nGo to the \"How the Heart Works\" section of this article for more details about how a normal heart works compared with a heart that has PDA.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPDA is a type of congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defect. A congenital heart defect is any type of heart problem that's present at birth.\n                \nIf your baby has a PDA but an otherwise normal heart, the PDA may shrink and go away. However, some children need treatment to close their PDAs.\n                \nSome children who have PDAs are given medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open. For example, this may be done if a child is born with another heart defect that decreases blood flow to the lungs or the rest of the body.\n                \nKeeping the PDA open helps maintain blood flow and oxygen levels until doctors can do surgery to correct the other heart defect.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPDA is a fairly common congenital heart defect in the United States. Although the condition can affect full-term infants, it's more common in premature infants.\n                \nOn average, PDA occurs in about 8 out of every 1,000 premature babies, compared with 2out of every 1,000 full-term babies. Premature babies also are more vulnerable to the effects of PDA.\n                \nPDA is twice as common in girls as it is in boys.\n                \nDoctors treat the condition with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. Most children who have PDAs live healthy, normal lives after treatment."

            "question": "How to diagnose Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?",
            "answer": "In full-term infants, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) usually is first suspected when the baby's doctor hears a heart murmur during a regular checkup.\n                \nA heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Heart murmurs also have other causes besides PDA, and most murmurs are harmless.\n                \nIf a PDA is large, the infant also may develop symptoms of volume overload and increased blood flow to the lungs. If a PDA is small, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood.\n                \nIf your child's doctor thinks your child has PDA, he or she may refer you to a pediatric cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children.\n                \nPremature babies who have PDA may not have the same signs as full-term babies, such as heart murmurs. Doctors may suspect PDA in premature babies who develop breathing problems soon after birth. Tests can help confirm a diagnosis.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your baby's heart. During echo, the sound waves bounce off your childs heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures of the hearts structures.\n                \nThe test allows the doctor to clearly see any problems with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working. Echo is the most important test available to your baby's cardiologist to both diagnose a heart problem and follow the problem over time.\n                \nIn babies who have PDA, echo shows how big the PDA is and how well the heart is responding to it. When medical treatments are used to try to close a PDA, echo is used to see how well the treatments are working.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. For babies who have PDA, an EKG can show whether the heart is enlarged. The test also can show other subtle changes that can suggest the presence of a PDA."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?",
            "answer": "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is treated with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. The goal of treatment is to close the PDA. Closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume.\n                \nSmall PDAs often close without treatment. For full-term infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is large or causing health problems. For premature infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is causing breathing problems or heart problems.\n                \nTalk with your child's doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour child's doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your child's PDA.\n                \nIndomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) is a medicine that helps close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine triggers the PDA to constrict or tighten, which closes the opening. Indomethacin usually doesn't work in full-term infants.\n                \nIbuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine is similar to indomethacin.\n                \nCatheter-Based Procedures\n                \nCatheters are thin, flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Catheter-based procedures often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure.\n                \nYour child's doctor may refer to the procedure as \"transcatheter device closure.\" The procedure sometimes is used for small PDAs to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.\n                \nYour child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure. The doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin (upper thigh). He or she will then guide the catheter to your child's heart.\n                \nA small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the PDA. This device blocks blood flow through the vessel.\n                \nCatheter-based procedures don't require the child's chest to be opened. They also allow the child to recover quickly.\n                \nThese procedures often are done on an outpatient basis. You'll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done.\n                \nComplications from catheter-based procedures are rare and short term. They can include bleeding, infection, and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery to correct a PDA may be done if:\n                \nA premature or full-term infant has health problems due to a PDA and is too small to have a catheter-based procedure\n                \nA catheter-based procedure doesn't successfully close the PDA\n                \nSurgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects\n                \nOften, surgery isn't done until after 6 months of age in infants who don't have health problems from their PDAs. Doctors sometimes do surgery on small PDAs to prevent the risk of IE.\n                \nFor the surgery, your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. The surgeon will make a small incision (cut) between your child's ribs to reach the PDA. He or she will close the PDA using stitches or clips.\n                \nComplications from surgery are rare and usually short term. They can include hoarseness, a paralyzed diaphragm (the muscle below the lungs), infection, bleeding, or fluid buildup around the lungs.\n                \nAfter Surgery\n                \nAfter surgery, your child will spend a few days in the hospital. He or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety. Most children go home 2 days after surgery. Premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues.\n                \nThe doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home. They will talk to you about:\n                \nLimits on activity for your child while he or she recovers\n                \nFollowup appointments with your child's doctors\n                \nHow to give your child medicines at home, if needed\n                \nWhen your child goes home after surgery, you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable. However, you child may have some short-term pain.\n                \nYour child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly. Within a few weeks, he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities.\n                \nLong-term complications from surgery are rare. However, they can include narrowing of the aorta, incomplete closure of the PDA, and reopening of the PDA."

            "question": "What causes Heart Disease in Women ?",
            "answer": "Research suggests thatcoronary heart disease(CHD) begins with damage to the lining and inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. Several factors contribute to this damage. They include:\n                \nSmoking, including secondhand smoke\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats andcholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nBlood vessel inflammation\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.\n                \nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause chest pain or discomfort calledangina.\n                \nIf the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsenangina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack.\n                \nIn addition to the factors above, low estrogen levels before or after menopause may play a role in causingcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the heart's tiny arteries.\n                \nThe cause of broken heart syndrome isn't yet known. However, a sudden release of stress hormones may play a role in causing the disorder. Most cases of broken heart syndrome occur in women who have gone through menopause."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Heart Disease in Women? ?",
            "answer": "Certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk forcoronary heart disease(CHD). These conditions are known as risk factors. Risk factors also increase the chance that existing CHD will worsen.\n                \nWomen generally have the same CHD risk factors as men. However, some risk factors may affect women differently than men. For example, diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women. Also, some risk factors, such as birth control pills and menopause, only affect women.\n                \nThere are many known CHD risk factors. Your risk for CHD andheart attackrises with the number of risk factors you have and their severity. Risk factors tend to \"gang up\" and worsen each other's effects.\n                \nHaving just one risk factor doubles your risk for CHD. Having two risk factors increases your risk for CHD fourfold. Having three or more risk factors increases your risk for CHD more than tenfold.\n                \nAlso, some risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, put you at greater risk for CHD and heart attack than others.\n                \nMore than 75 percent of women aged 40 to 60 have one or more risk factors for CHD. Many risk factors start during childhood; some even develop within the first 10 years of life. You can control most risk factors, but some you can't.\n                \nFor more information about CHD risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factorsarticle. To find out whether you're at risk for CHD, talk with your doctor or health care provider.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can Control\n                \nSmoking\n                \nSmoking is the most powerful risk factor that women can control. Smoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk for CHD and heart attack.\n                \nSmoking exposes you to carbon monoxide. This chemical robs your blood of oxygen and triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries.\n                \nSmoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. Blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack. The more you smoke, the greater your risk for a heart attack.\n                \nEven women who smoke fewer than two cigarettes a day are at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nHigh Blood Cholesterol and High Triglyceride Levels\n                \nCholesterol travels in the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (LI-po-pro-teens). The two major kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n                \nLDL cholesterol is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. HDL cholesterol is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nA blood test called a lipoprotein panel is used to measure cholesterol levels. This test gives information about your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood).\n                \nCholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. A woman's risk for CHD increases if she has a total cholesterol level greater than 200 mg/dL, an LDL cholesterol level greater than 100 mg/dL, or an HDL cholesterol level less than 50 mg/dL.\n                \nA triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dL also increases a woman's risk for CHD. A woman's HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels predict her risk for CHD better than her total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\n                \nWomen who have blood pressure greater than 120/80 mmHg are at increased risk for CHD. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nHigh blood pressure is defined differently for people who have diabetes or chronic kidney disease. If you have one of these diseases, work with your doctor to set a healthy blood pressure goal.\n                \nDiabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood sugar level is too high. This is because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\n                \nInsulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it's used for energy. Over time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries.\n                \nPrediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. Prediabetes puts you at higher risk for both diabetes and CHD.\n                \nDiabetes and prediabetes raise the risk of CHD more in women than in men. In fact, having diabetes doubles a woman's risk of developing CHD.\n                \nBefore menopause, estrogen provides women some protection against CHD. However, in women who have diabetes, the disease counters the protective effects of estrogen.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity\n                \nThe terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nThe most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nYou can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nStudies suggest that where extra weight occurs on the body may predict CHD risk better than BMI. Women who carry much of their fat around the waist are at greatest risk for CHD. These women have \"apple-shaped\" figures.\n                \nWomen who carry most of their fat on their hips and thighsthat is, those who have \"pear-shaped\" figuresare at lower risk for CHD.\n                \nTo fully know how excess weight affects your CHD risk, you should know your BMI and waist measurement. If you have a BMI greater than 24.9 and a waist measurement greater than 35 inches, you're at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nIf your waist measurement divided by your hip measurement is greater than 0.9, you're also at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nStudies also suggest that women whose weight goes up and down dramatically (typically due to unhealthy dieting) are at increased risk for CHD. These swings in weight can lower HDL cholesterol levels.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndromeis the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:\n                \nA large waistline. Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\n                \nA higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).\n                \nA lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).\n                \nHigher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nHigher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes)\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is more common in African American women and Mexican American women than in men of the same racial groups. The condition affects White women and men about equally.\n                \nBirth Control Pills\n                \nWomen who smoke and take birth control pills are at very high risk for CHD, especially if they're older than 35. For women who take birth control pills but don't smoke, the risk of CHD isn't fully known.\n                \nLack of Physical Activity\n                \nInactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop CHD as those who are physically active. A lack of physical activity can worsen other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy Diet\n                \nAn unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. For example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise your LDL cholesterol level. A high-sodium (salt) diet can raise your risk for high blood pressure.\n                \nFoods with added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. This can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk for CHD.\n                \nToo much alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, and it will raise your blood pressure.\n                \nStress or Depression\n                \nStress may play a role in causing CHD. Stress can trigger your arteries to narrow. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk for a heart attack.\n                \nGetting upset or angry also can trigger a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk for CHD if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.\n                \nPeople who are depressed are two to three times more likely to develop CHD than people who are not. Depression is twice as common in women as in men.\n                \nAnemia\n                \nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-eh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nThe condition also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your organs.\n                \nIf you have anemia, your organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood. This causes your heart to work harder, which may raise your risk for CHD.\n                \nAnemia has many causes. For more information, go to the Health Topics Anemiaarticle.\n                \nSleep Apnea\n                \nSleep apneais a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour.\n                \nTypically, normal breathing starts again after the pause, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. Major signs of sleep apnea are snoring and daytime sleepiness.\n                \nWhen you stop breathing, the lack of oxygen triggers your body's stress hormones. This causes blood pressure to rise and makes the blood more likely to clot.\n                \nUntreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nWomen are more likely to develop sleep apnea after menopause.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can't Control\n                \nAge and Menopause\n                \nAs you get older, your risk for CHD and heart attack rises. This is due in part to the slow buildup of plaque inside your heart arteries, which can start during childhood.\n                \nBefore age 55, women have a lower risk for CHD than men. Estrogen provides women with some protection against CHD before menopause. After age 55, however, the risk of CHD increases in both women and men.\n                \nYou may have gone through early menopause, either naturally or because you had your ovaries removed. If so, you're twice as likely to develop CHD as women of the same age who aren't yet menopausal.\n                \nAnother reason why women are at increased risk for CHD after age 55 is that middle age is when you tend to develop other CHD risk factors.\n                \nWomen who have gone through menopause also are at increased risk for broken heart syndrome. (For more information, go to the section on emerging risk factors below.)\n                \nFamily History\n                \nFamily history plays a role in CHD risk. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with CHD before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with CHD before 65 years of age.\n                \nAlso, a family history of strokeespecially a mother's stroke historycan help predict the risk of heart attack in women.\n                \nHaving a family history of CHD or stroke doesn't mean that you'll develop heart disease. This is especially true if your affected family member smoked or had other risk factors that were not well treated.\n                \nMaking lifestyle changes and taking medicines to treat risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent or delay heart problems.\n                \nPreeclampsia\n                \nPreeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah) is a condition that develops during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.\n                \nThese signs usually occur during the second half of pregnancy and go away after delivery. However, your risk of developing high blood pressure later in life increases after having preeclampsia.\n                \nPreeclampsia also is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, and heart failure. (Likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases your risk for preeclampsia.)\n                \nIf you had preeclampsia during pregnancy, you're twice as likely to develop heart disease as women who haven't had the condition. You're also more likely to develop heart disease earlier in life.\n                \nPreeclampsia is a heart disease risk factor that you can't control. However, if you've had the condition, you should take extra care to try and control other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nThe more severe your preeclampsia was, the greater your risk for heart disease. Let your doctor know that you had preeclampsia so he or she can assess your heart disease risk and how to reduce it.\n                \nEmerging Risk Factors\n                \nResearch suggests that inflammation plays a role in causing CHD. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.\n                \nHigh blood levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) are a sign of inflammation in the body. Research suggests that women who have high blood levels of CRP are at increased risk for heart attack.\n                \nAlso, some inflammatory diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may increase the risk for CHD.\n                \nSome studies suggest that women who have migraine headaches may be at greater risk for CHD. This is especially true for women who have migraines with auras (visual disturbances), such as flashes of light or zig-zag lines.\n                \nLow bone density and low intake of folate and vitamin B6 also may raise a woman's risk for CHD.\n                \nMore research is needed to find out whether calcium supplements with or without vitamin D affect CHD risk. You may want to talk with your doctor to find out whether these types of supplements are right for you.\n                \nResearchers are just starting to learn about broken heart syndrome risk factors. Most women who have this disorder are White and have gone through menopause.\n                \nMany of these women have other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. However, these risk factors tend to be less common in women who have broken heart syndrome than in women who have CHD."

This is called silent CHD.\n                \nSilent CHD may not be diagnosed until a woman has signs and symptoms of aheart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia(irregular heartbeat).\n                \nOther women who have CHD will have signs and symptoms of the disease.\n                \nHeart Disease Signs and Symptoms\n                \n\n                \nA common symptom of CHD isangina.Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nIn men, angina often feels like pressure or squeezing in the chest. This feeling may extend to the arms. Women can also have these angina symptoms. But women also tend to describe a sharp, burning chest pain. Women are more likely to have pain in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back.\n                \nIn men, angina tends to worsen with physical activity and go away with rest. Women are more likely than men to have angina while they're resting or sleeping.\n                \nIn women who havecoronary microvascular disease, angina often occurs during routine daily activities, such as shopping or cooking, rather than while exercising. Mental stress also is more likely to trigger angina pain in women than in men.\n                \nThe severity of angina varies. The pain may get worse or occur more often as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms Coronary Heart Disease Complications\n                \nHeart Attack\n                \nThe most common heart attack symptom in men and women is chest pain or discomfort. However, only half of women who have heart attacks have chest pain.\n                \nWomen are more likely than men to report back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, extreme fatigue (tiredness), or problems breathing.\n                \nHeart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms are light-headedness and dizziness, which occur more often in women than men.\n                \nMen are more likely than women to break out in a cold sweat and to report pain in the left arm during a heart attack.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart can't cope with the demands of everyday activities.\n                \nHeart failure causes shortness of breath and fatigue that tends to increase with physical exertion. Heart failure also can cause swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.\n                \nArrhythmia\n                \nAn arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\n                \nSome people describe arrhythmias as fluttering or thumping feelings or skipped beats in their chests. These feelings are calledpalpitations.\n                \nSome arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. This condition is calledsudden cardiac arrest(SCA). SCA causes loss of consciousness and death if it's not treated right away.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Broken Heart Syndrome\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome are chest pain and shortness of breath. In this disorder, these symptoms tend to occur suddenly in people who have no history of heart disease.\n                \nArrhythmias orcardiogenic shockalso may occur. Cardiogenic shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n                \nSome of the signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome differ from those of heart attack. For example, in people who have broken heart syndrome:\n                \nSymptoms occur suddenly after having extreme emotional or physical stress.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram) results don't look the same as the EKG results for a person having a heart attack. (An EKG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity.)\n                \nBlood tests show no signs or mild signs of heart damage.\n                \nTests show no signs of blockages in the coronary arteries.\n                \nTests show ballooning and unusual movement of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle).\n                \nRecovery time is quick, usually within days or weeks (compared with the recovery time of a month or more for a heart attack)."

            "question": "How to diagnose Heart Disease in Women ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnosecoronary heart disease(CHD) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nNo single test can diagnose CHD. If your doctor thinks you have CHD, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKGis a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nStress Testing\n                \nDuringstress testing,you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicines to increase your heart rate.\n                \nWhen your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed coronary (heart) arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\n                \nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\n                \nShortness of breath or chest pain\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\n                \nIf you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. However, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases,anemia, or poor general fitness).\n                \nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nAchest x raycreates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray can reveal signs ofheart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for CHD. Blood tests also help detectanemia,a risk factor for CHD.\n                \nDuring a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. High levels of these proteins are a sign of a recent heart attack.\n                \nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\n                \nYour doctor may recommendcoronary angiography(an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors suggest you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure calledcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nCoronary angiography detects blockages in the large coronary arteries. However, the test doesn't detectcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). This is because coronary MVD doesn't cause blockages in the large coronary arteries.\n                \nEven if the results of your coronary angiography are normal, you may still have chest pain or other CHD symptoms. If so, talk with your doctor about whether you might have coronary MVD.\n                \nYour doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire called the Duke Activity Status Index. This questionnaire measures how easily you can do routine tasks. It gives your doctor information about how well blood is flowing through your coronary arteries.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend other tests that measure blood flow in the heart, such as acardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) stress test.\n                \nCardiac MRI uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it beats. The test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\n                \nOther tests done during cardiac catheterization can check blood flow in the heart's small arteries and the thickness of the artery walls.\n                \nTests Used To Diagnose Broken Heart Syndrome\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have broken heart syndrome, he or she may recommend coronary angiography. Other tests are also used to diagnose this disorder, including blood tests, EKG, echo, and cardiac MRI."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Disease in Women ?",
            "answer": "Treatment forcoronary heart disease (CHD) usually is the same for both women and men. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical and surgical procedures, andcardiac rehabilitation(rehab).\n                \nThe goals of treatment are to:\n                \nRelieve symptoms.\n                \nReduce risk factors in an effort to slow, stop, or reverse the buildup of plaque.\n                \nLower the risk of blood clots forming. (Blood clots can cause aheart attack.)\n                \nWiden or bypass plaque-clogged coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nPrevent CHD complications.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nMaking lifestyle changes can help prevent or treat CHD. These changes may be the only treatment that some people need.\n                \nQuit Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke or use tobacco, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD and heart attack and worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you find it hard to quit smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nFollow a Healthy Diet\n                \nA healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. These foods can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. A good rule is to try to fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits.\n                \nA healthy diet also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nChoose and prepare foods with little sodium (salt). Too much salt can raise your risk for high blood pressure. Studies show that following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan can lower blood pressure.\n                \nTry to avoid foods and drinks that are high in added sugars. For example, drink water instead of sugary drinks, like soda.\n                \nAlso, try to limit the amount of solid fats and refined grains that you eat. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\n                \nIf you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Research suggests that regularly drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may lower the risk of CHD. Women should have no more than one alcoholic drink a day.\n                \nOne drink a day can lower your CHD risk by raising your HDL cholesterol level. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.\n                \nIf you don't drink, this isn't a recommendation to start using alcohol. Also, you shouldn't drink if you're pregnant, if you're planning to become pregnant, or if you have another health condition that could make alcohol use harmful.\n                \nToo much alcohol can cause you to gain weight and raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. In women, even one drink a day may raise the risk of certain types of cancer.\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nBe Physically Active\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including high LDL cholesterol,high blood pressure, and excess weight.\n                \nPhysical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. (HDL cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.)\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nPeople gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Walking is an excellent heart healthy exercise. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nMaintain a Healthy Weight\n                \nOverweight and obesity are risk factors for CHD. If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Cut back your calorie intake and do more physical activity. Eat smaller portions and choose lower calorie foods. Your health care provider may refer you to a dietitian to help you manage your weight.\n                \nA BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches or less is the goal for preventing and treating CHD. BMI measures your weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nTo measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out. Make sure the tape is snug but doesn't squeeze the flesh.\n                \nFor more information about losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site.\n                \nStress and Depression\n                \nResearch shows that getting upset or angry can trigger a heart attack. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingaren't heart healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\n                \nHaving supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, yoga, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.\n                \nDepression can double or triple your risk for CHD. Depression also makes it hard to maintain a heart healthy lifestyle.\n                \nTalk with your doctor if you have symptoms of depression, such as feeling hopeless or not taking interest in daily activities. He or she may recommend counseling or prescribe medicines to help you manage the condition.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYou may need medicines to treat CHD if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Medicines can help:\n                \nReduce your heart's workload and relieve CHD symptoms\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly\n                \nLower your LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and other CHD risk factors\n                \nPrevent blood clots\n                \nPrevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such asangioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\n                \nWomen who havecoronary microvascular disease and anemiamay benefit from taking medicine to treat the anemia.\n                \nWomen who have broken heart syndrome also may need medicines. Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks.\n                \nTake all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.\n                \nMenopausal Hormone Therapy\n                \nRecent studies have shown that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) doesn't prevent CHD. Some studies have even shown that MHT increases women's risk for CHD, stroke, and breast cancer.\n                \nHowever, these studies tested MHT on women who had been postmenopausal for at least several years. During that time, they could have already developed CHD.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to see whether MHT helps prevent CHD when taken right when menopause starts. While questions remain, current findings suggest MHT shouldn't routinely be used to prevent or treat CHD.\n                \nAsk your doctor about other ways to prevent or treat CHD, including lifestyle changes and medicines. For more information about MHT, go to the NHLBI's Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Web site.\n                \nProcedures and Surgery\n                \nYou may need a procedure or surgery to treat CHD. Both angioplasty and CABG are used as treatments. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you.\n                \nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee), is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries.\n                \nA thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery.\n                \nPCI can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics PCI article.\n                \nCoronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n                \nCABG is a type of surgery. During CABG, a surgeon removes arteries or veins from other areas in your body and uses them to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\n                \nCABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting article.\n                \nCardiac Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe cardiac rehab foranginaor after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Almost everyone who has CHD can benefit from cardiac rehab.\n                \nCardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.\n                \nThe cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.\n                \nCardiac rehab has two parts:\n                \nExercise training. This part of rehab helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.\n                \nEducation, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to lower your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and with your fears about the future.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Cardiac Rehabilitation article."

            "question": "What is (are) Thalassemias ?",
            "answer": "Thalassemias (thal-a-SE-me-ahs) are inherited blood disorders. \"Inherited\" means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nThalassemias cause the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) than normal. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from the body to the lungs, where it's exhaled.\n                \nPeople who have thalassemias can have mild or severe anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh). Anemia is caused by a lower than normal number of red blood cells or not enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells.\n                \nOverview\n                \nNormal hemoglobin, also called hemoglobin A, has four protein chainstwo alpha globin and two beta globin. The two major types of thalassemia, alpha and beta, are named after defects in these protein chains.\n                \nFour genes (two from each parent) are needed to make enough alpha globin protein chains. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs if one or two of the four genes are missing. If more than two genes are missing, moderate to severe anemia occurs.\n                \nThe most severe form of alpha thalassemia is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have this disorder usually die before or shortly after birth.\n                \nTwo genes (one from each parent) are needed to make enough beta globin protein chains. Beta thalassemia occurs if one or both genes are altered.\n                \nThe severity of beta thalassemia depends on how much one or both genes are affected. If both genes are affected, the result is moderate to severe anemia. The severe form of beta thalassemia is known as thalassemia major or Cooley's anemia.\n                \nThalassemias affect males and females. The disorders occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent. Severe forms usually are diagnosed in early childhood and are lifelong conditions.\n                \nDoctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests. The disorders are treated with blood transfusions, medicines, and other procedures.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nTreatments for thalassemias have improved over the years. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias are now living longer and have better quality of life.\n                \nHowever, complications from thalassemias and their treatments are frequent. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias must closely follow their treatment plans. They need to take care of themselves to remain as healthy as possible."

            "question": "What causes Thalassemias ?",
            "answer": "Your body makes three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets). Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your body to your lungs, where it's exhaled.\n                \nHemoglobin has two kinds of protein chains: alpha globin and beta globin. If your body doesn't make enough of these protein chains or they're abnormal, red blood cells won't form correctly or carry enough oxygen. Your body won't work well if your red blood cells don't make enough healthy hemoglobin.\n                \nGenes control how the body makes hemoglobin protein chains. When these genes are missing or altered, thalassemias occur.\n                \nThalassemias are inherited disordersthat is, they're passed from parents to children through genes. People who inherit faulty hemoglobin genes from one parent but normal genes from the other are called carriers. Carriers often have no signs of illness other than mild anemia. However, they can pass the faulty genes on to their children.\n                \nPeople who have moderate to severe forms of thalassemia have inherited faulty genes from both parents.\n                \nAlpha Thalassemias\n                \nYou need four genes (two from each parent) to make enough alpha globin protein chains. If one or more of the genes is missing, you'll have alpha thalassemia trait or disease. This means that your body doesn't make enough alpha globin protein.\n                \nIf you're only missing one gene, you're a \"silent\" carrier. This means you won't have any signs of illness.\n                \nIf you're missing two genes, you have alpha thalassemia trait (also called alpha thalassemia minor). You may have mild anemia.\n                \nIf you're missing three genes, you likely have hemoglobin H disease (which a blood test can detect). This form of thalassemia causes moderate to severe anemia.\n                \nVery rarely, a baby is missing all four genes. This condition is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have hydrops fetalis usually die before or shortly after birth.\n                \nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Alpha Thalassemia\n                \n\n                \nBeta Thalassemias\n                \nYou need two genes (one from each parent) to make enough beta globin protein chains. If one or both of these genes are altered, you'll have beta thalassemia. This means that your body wont make enough beta globin protein.\n                \nIf you have one altered gene, you're a carrier. This condition is called beta thalassemia trait or beta thalassemia minor. It causes mild anemia.\n                \nIf both genes are altered, you'll have beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia). The intermedia form of the disorder causes moderate anemia. The major form causes severe anemia.\n                \nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Beta Thalassemia"

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Thalassemias ?",
            "answer": "A lack of oxygen in the bloodstream causes the signs and symptoms of thalassemias. The lack of oxygen occurs because the body doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin. The severity of symptoms depends on the severity of the disorder.\n                \nNo Symptoms\n                \nAlpha thalassemia silent carriers generally have no signs or symptoms of the disorder. The lack of alpha globin protein is so minor that the body's hemoglobin works normally.\n                \nMild Anemia\n                \nPeople who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait can have mild anemia. However, many people who have these types of thalassemia have no signs or symptoms.\n                \nMild anemia can make you feel tired. Mild anemia caused by alpha thalassemia trait might be mistaken for iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nMild to Moderate Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPeople who have beta thalassemia intermedia have mild to moderate anemia. They also may have other health problems, such as:\n                \nSlowed growth and delayed puberty. Anemia can slow down a child's growth and development.\n                \nBone problems. Thalassemia may cause bone marrow to expand. Bone marrow is the spongy substance inside bones that makes blood cells. When bone marrow expands, the bones become wider than normal. They may become brittle and break easily.\n                \nAn enlarged spleen. The spleen is an organ that helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted material. When a person has thalassemia, the spleen has to work very hard. As a result, the spleen becomes larger than normal. This makes anemia worse. If the spleen becomes too large, it must be removed.\n                \nSevere Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPeople who have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia) have severe thalassemia. Signs and symptoms usually occur within the first 2years of life. They may include severe anemia and other health problems, such as:\n                \nA pale and listless appearance\n                \nPoor appetite\n                \nDark urine (a sign that red blood cells are breaking down)\n                \nSlowed growth and delayed puberty\n                \nJaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\n                \nAn enlarged spleen, liver, or heart\n                \nBone problems (especially with bones in the face)\n                \nComplications of Thalassemias\n                \nBetter treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live much longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications of these disorders that occur over time.\n                \nHeart and Liver Diseases\n                \nRegular blood transfusions are a standard treatment for thalassemias. Transfusions can cause iron to build up in the blood (iron overload). This can damage organs and tissues, especially the heart and liver.\n                \nHeart disease caused by iron overload is the main cause of death in people who have thalassemias. Heart disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart attack.\n                \nInfection\n                \nAmong people who have thalassemias, infections are a key cause of illness and the second most common cause of death. People who have had their spleens removed are at even higher risk because they no longer have this infection-fighting organ.\n                \nOsteoporosis\n                \nMany people who have thalassemias have bone problems, including osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). This is a condition in which bones are weak and brittle and break easily."

            "question": "How to diagnose Thalassemias ?",
            "answer": "Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and special hemoglobin tests.\n                \nA CBC measures the amount of hemoglobin and the different kinds of blood cells, such as red blood cells, in a sample of blood. People who have thalassemias have fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal in their blood. People who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait may have red blood cells that are smaller than normal.\n                \nHemoglobin tests measure the types of hemoglobin in a blood sample. People who have thalassemias have problems with the alpha or beta globin protein chains of hemoglobin.\n                \nModerate and severe thalassemias usually are diagnosed in early childhood. This is because signs and symptoms, including severe anemia, often occur within the first 2years of life.\n                \nPeople who have milder forms of thalassemia might be diagnosed after a routine blood test shows they have anemia. Doctors might suspect thalassemia if a person has anemia and is a member of an ethnic group that's at increased risk for thalassemias. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Thalassemias?\")\n                \nDoctors also test the amount of iron in the blood to find out whether the anemia is due to iron deficiency or thalassemia. Iron-deficiency anemia occurs if the body doesn't have enough iron to make hemoglobin. The anemia in thalassemia occurs because of a problem with either the alpha globin or beta globin chains of hemoglobin, not because of a lack of iron.\n                \nBecause thalassemias are passed from parents to children through genes, family genetic studies also can help diagnose the disorder. These studies involve taking a family medical history and doing blood tests on family members. The tests will show whether any family members have missing or altered hemoglobin genes.\n                \nIf you know of family members who have thalassemias and you're thinking of having children, consider talking with your doctor and a genetic counselor. They can help determine your risk for passing the disorder to your children.\n                \nIf you're expecting a baby and you and your partner are thalassemia carriers, you may want to consider prenatal testing.\n                \nPrenatal testing involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from the placenta. (Amniotic fluid is the fluid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo. The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) Tests done on the fluid or tissue can show whether your baby has thalassemia and how severe it might be."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Thalassemias ?",
            "answer": "Treatments for thalassemias depend on the type and severity of the disorder. People who are carriers or who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait have mild or no symptoms. Theyll likely need little or no treatment.\n                \nDoctors use three standard treatments for moderate and severe forms of thalassemia. These treatments include blood transfusions, iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, and folic acid supplements. Other treatments have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.\n                \nStandard Treatments\n                \nBlood Transfusions\n                \nTransfusions of red blood cells are the main treatment for people who have moderate or severe thalassemias. This treatment gives you healthy red blood cells with normal hemoglobin.\n                \nDuring a blood transfusion, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours.\n                \nRed blood cells live only for about 120 days. So, you may need repeated transfusions to maintain a healthy supply of red blood cells.\n                \nIf you have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia intermedia, you may need blood transfusions on occasion. For example, you may have transfusions when you have an infection or other illness, or when your anemia is severe enough to cause tiredness.\n                \nIf you have beta thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia), youll likely need regular blood transfusions (often every 2 to 4 weeks). These transfusions will help you maintain normal hemoglobin and red blood cell levels.\n                \nBlood transfusions allow you to feel better, enjoy normal activities, and live into adulthood. This treatment is lifesaving, but it's expensive and carries a risk of transmitting infections and viruses (for example, hepatitis). However, the risk is very low in the United States because of careful blood screening.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nIron Chelation Therapy\n                \nThe hemoglobin in red blood cells is an iron-rich protein. Thus, regular blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the blood. This condition is called iron overload. It damages the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.\n                \nTo prevent this damage, doctors use iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. Two medicines are used for iron chelation therapy.\n                \nDeferoxamine is a liquid medicine that's given slowly under the skin, usually with a small portable pump used overnight. This therapy takes time and can be mildly painful. Side effects include problems with vision and hearing.\n                \nDeferasirox is a pill taken once daily. Side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, and tiredness.\n                \nFolic Acid Supplements\n                \nFolic acid is a B vitamin that helps build healthy red blood cells. Your doctor may recommend folic acid supplements in addition to treatment with blood transfusions and/or iron chelation therapy.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments for thalassemias have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are the cells inside bone marrow that make red blood cells and other types of blood cells.\n                \nA stem cell transplant is the only treatment that can cure thalassemia. But only a small number of people who have severe thalassemias are able to find a good donor match and have the risky procedure.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\n                \nPossible Future Treatments\n                \nResearchers are working to find new treatments for thalassemias. For example, it might be possible someday to insert a normal hemoglobin gene into stem cells in bone marrow. This will allow people who have thalassemias to make their own healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin.\n                \nResearchers also are studying ways to trigger a person's ability to make fetal hemoglobin after birth. This type of hemoglobin is found in fetuses and newborns. After birth, the body switches to making adult hemoglobin. Making more fetal hemoglobin might make up for the lack of healthy adult hemoglobin.\n                \nTreating Complications\n                \nBetter treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications that occur over time.\n                \nAn important part of managing thalassemias is treating complications.

            "answer": "A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. Murmurs range from very faint to very loud. Sometimes they sound like a whooshing or swishing noise.\n                \nNormal heartbeats make a \"lub-DUPP\" or \"lub-DUB\" sound. This is the sound of the heart valves closing as blood moves through the heart. Doctors can hear these sounds and heart murmurs using a stethoscope.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe two types of heart murmurs are innocent (harmless) and abnormal.\n                \nInnocent heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems. These murmurs are common in healthy children. Many children will have heart murmurs heard by their doctors at some point in their lives.\n                \nPeople who have abnormal heart murmurs may have signs or symptoms of heart problems. Most abnormal murmurs in children are caused by congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth.\n                \nIn adults, abnormal heart murmurs most often are caused by acquired heart valve disease.

Infections, diseases, and aging can cause heart valve disease.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nA heart murmur isn't a disease, and most murmurs are harmless. Innocent murmurs don't cause symptoms. Having one doesn't require you to limit your physical activity or do anything else special. Although you may have an innocent murmur throughout your life, you won't need treatment for it.\n                \nThe outlook and treatment for abnormal heart murmurs depend on the type and severity of the heart problem causing them."

            "answer": "Innocent Heart Murmurs\n                \nWhy some people have innocent heart murmurs and others do not isn't known. Innocent murmurs are simply sounds made by blood flowing through the heart's chambers and valves, or through blood vessels near the heart.\n                \nExtra blood flow through the heart also may cause innocent heart murmurs. After childhood, the most common cause of extra blood flow through the heart is pregnancy. This is because during pregnancy, women's bodies make extra blood. Most heart murmurs that occur in pregnant women are innocent.\n                \nAbnormal Heart Murmurs\n                \nCongenital heart defects or acquired heart valve disease often are the cause of abnormal heart murmurs.\n                \nCongenital Heart Defects\n                \nCongenital heart defects are the most common cause of abnormal heart murmurs in children. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. They change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nCongenital heart defects can involve the interior walls of the heart, the valves inside the heart, or the arteries and veins that carry blood to and from the heart. Some babies are born with more than one heart defect.\n                \nHeart valve problems, septal defects (also called holes in the heart), and diseases of the heart muscle such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are common heart defects that cause abnormal heart murmurs.\n                \nExamples of valve problems are narrow valves that limit blood flow or leaky valves that don't close properly. Septal defects are holes in the wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart. This wall is called the septum.\n                \nA hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect. A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect.\n                \nHypertrophic (hi-per-TROF-ik) cardiomyopathy (kar-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee) (HCM) occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles (usually the left ventricle) to thicken. The thickening may block blood flow out of the ventricle. If a blockage occurs, the ventricle must work hard to pump blood to the body. HCM also can affect the hearts mitral valve, causing blood to leak backward through the valve.\n                \nHeart Defects That Can Cause Abnormal Heart Murmurs\n                \n\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Congenital Heart Defects article.\n                \nAcquired Heart Valve Disease\n                \nAcquired heart valve disease often is the cause of abnormal heart murmurs in adults. This is heart valve disease that develops as the result of another condition.\n                \nMany conditions can cause heart valve disease. Examples include heart conditions and other disorders, age-related changes, rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) fever, and infections.\n                \nHeart conditions and other disorders. Certain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves, such as:\n                \nDamage and scar tissue from a heart attack or injury to the heart.\n                \nAdvanced high blood pressure and heart failure. These conditions can enlarge the heart or its main arteries.\n                \nAge-related changes. As you get older, calcium deposits or other deposits may form on your heart valves. These deposits stiffen and thicken the valve flaps and limit blood flow. This stiffening and thickening of the valve is called sclerosis (skle-RO-sis).\n                \nRheumatic fever. The bacteria that cause strep throat, scarlet fever, and, in some cases, impetigo (im-peh-TI-go) also can cause rheumatic fever. This serious illness can develop if you have an untreated or not fully treated streptococcal (strep) infection.\n                \nRheumatic fever can damage and scar the heart valves. The symptoms of this heart valve damage often don't occur until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever.\n                \nToday, most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever develops. It's very important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes for strep throat, even if you feel better before the medicine is gone.\n                \nInfections. Common germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart, including the heart valves. This rare but sometimes life-threatening infection is called infective endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis), or IE.\n                \nIE is more likely to develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve because of heart valve disease. The abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve. The blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve.\n                \nIE can worsen existing heart valve disease.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nSome heart murmurs occur because of an illness outside of the heart. The heart is normal, but an illness or condition can cause blood flow that's faster than normal. Examples of this type of illness include fever, anemia (uh-NEE-me-eh), and hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAnemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the body has too much thyroid hormone."

            "answer": "Doctors use a stethoscope to listen to heart sounds and hear heart murmurs. They may detect heart murmurs during routine checkups or while checking for another condition.\n                \nIf a congenital heart defect causes a murmur, it's often heard at birth or during infancy. Abnormal heart murmurs caused by other heart problems can be heard in patients of any age.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctors usually refer people who have abnormal heart murmurs to cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists for further care and testing.\n                \nCardiologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems in adults. Pediatric cardiologists specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will carefully listen to your heart or your child's heart with a stethoscope to find out whether a murmur is innocent or abnormal. He or she will listen to the loudness, location, and timing of the murmur. This will help your doctor diagnose the cause of the murmur.\n                \nYour doctor also may:\n                \nAsk about your medical and family histories.\n                \nDo a complete physical exam. He or she will look for signs of illness or physical problems. For example, your doctor may look for a bluish color on your skin. In infants, doctors may look for delayed growth and feeding problems.\n                \nAsk about your symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath (especially with physical exertion), dizziness, or fainting.\n                \nEvaluating Heart Murmurs\n                \nWhen evaluating a heart murmur, your doctor will pay attention to many things, such as:\n                \nHow faint or loud the sound is. Your doctor will grade the murmur on a scale of 1 to 6 (1 is very faint and 6 is very loud).\n                \nWhen the sound occurs in the cycle of the heartbeat.\n                \nWhere the sound is heard in the chest and whether it also can be heard in the neck or back.\n                \nWhether the sound has a high, medium, or low pitch.\n                \nHow long the sound lasts.\n                \nHow breathing, physical activity, or a change in body position affects the sound.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you or your child has an abnormal heart murmur, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test is done to find the cause of symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain.\n                \nEKG\n                \nAn EKG (electrocardiogram) is a simple test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nThis test is used to detect and locate the source of heart problems. The results from an EKG also may be used to rule out certain heart problems.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including a stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test. During this test, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Echo is used to take pictures of your heart before you exercise and as soon as you finish.\n                \nStress echo shows whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of coronary heart disease)."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Murmur ?",
            "answer": "A heart murmur isn't a disease. It's an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Thus, murmurs themselves don't require treatment.

However, lifestyle changes and medicines can treat symptoms and help delay complications. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.\n                \nFor more information about treatments for heart valve disease, go to the Health Topics Heart Valve Disease article."

This simple test records your heart's electrical activity.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nEven if your EKG results are normal, you may still have a medical condition that's causing palpitations.

It won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't happen during the test. To diagnose problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a Holter or event monitor.\n                \nA Holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.\n                \nDuring the 24- or 48-hour period, you do your usual daily activities. You use a notebook to record any symptoms you have and the time they occur. You then return both the recorder and the notebook to your doctor to read the results. Your doctor can see how your heart was beating at the time you had symptoms.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nFor many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nYou can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.\n                \nHolter or Event Monitor\n                \n\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nThe test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast."

Your body's organs, such as your heart and brain, need oxygen-rich blood to work well.\n                \nRespiratory failure also can occur if your lungs can't properly remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood. Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body's organs.\n                \nBoth of these problemsa low oxygen level and a high carbon dioxide level in the bloodcan occur at the same time.\n                \nDiseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and spinal cord injuries. COPD prevents enough air from flowing in and out of the airways. Spinal cord injuries can damage the nerves that control breathing.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand respiratory failure, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nSmall blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange.\n                \nIn respiratory failure, gas exchange is impaired.\n                \nRespiratory failure can be acute (short term) or chronic (ongoing). Acute respiratory failure can develop quickly and may require emergency treatment. Chronic respiratory failure develops more slowly and lasts longer.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of respiratory failure may include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and air hunger (feeling like you can't breathe in enough air). In severe cases, signs and symptoms may include a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails; confusion; and sleepiness.\n                \nOne of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition.\n                \nAcute respiratory failure usually is treated in an intensive care unit. Chronic respiratory failure can be treated at home or at a long-term care center.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe outlook for respiratory failure depends on the severity of its underlying cause, how quickly treatment begins, and your overall health.\n                \nPeople who have severe lung diseases may need long-term or ongoing breathing support, such as oxygen therapy or the help of a ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor). A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. It blows airor air with increased amounts of oxygeninto your airways and then your lungs."

            "question": "What causes Respiratory Failure ?",
            "answer": "Diseases and conditions that impair breathing can cause respiratory failure. These disorders may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing, or they may affect the lungs directly.\n                \nWhen breathing is impaired, your lungs can't easily move oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from your blood (gas exchange). This can cause a low oxygen level or high carbon dioxide level, or both, in your blood.\n                \nRespiratory failure can occur as a result of:\n                \nConditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing. Examples include muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injuries, and stroke.\n                \nDamage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage.\n                \nProblems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). This condition can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing.\n                \nDrug or alcohol overdose. An overdose affects the area of the brain that controls breathing. During an overdose, breathing becomes slow and shallow.\n                \nLung diseases and conditions, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis. These diseases and conditions can affect the flow of air and blood into and out of your lungs. ARDS and pneumonia affect gas exchange in the air sacs.\n                \nAcute lung injuries. For example, inhaling harmful fumes or smoke can injure your lungs.\n                \nNormal Lungs and Conditions Causing Respiratory Failure"

Lung diseases and conditions also can cause respiratory failure.\n                \nFor more information, go to \"What Causes Respiratory Failure?\"\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of respiratory failure and its underlying cause.\n                \nRespiratory failure can cause shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and air hunger (feeling like you can't breathe in enough air). Using a stethoscope, your doctor can listen to your lungs for abnormal sounds, such as crackling.\n                \nYour doctor also may listen to your heart for signs of an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). An arrhythmia can occur if your heart doesn't get enough oxygen.\n                \nYour doctor might look for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails. A bluish color means your blood has a low oxygen level.\n                \nRespiratory failure also can cause extreme sleepiness and confusion, so your doctor might check how alert you are.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nTo check the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood, you may have: \n                \nPulse oximetry. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\n                \nArterial blood gas test. This test measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. A blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured.\n                \nA low level of oxygen or a high level of carbon dioxide in the blood (or both) is a possible sign of respiratory failure.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other tests, such as a chest x ray, to help find the underlying cause of respiratory failure. A chest x ray is a painless test that takes pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have an arrhythmia as a result of respiratory failure, he or she may recommend an EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity."

            "answer": "Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and its severity. Treatment also depends on the condition's underlying cause.\n                \nAcute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. It often is treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure often can be treated at home. If chronic respiratory failure is severe, your doctor may recommend treatment in a long-term care center.\n                \nOne of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition.\n                \nOxygen Therapy and Ventilator Support\n                \nIf you have respiratory failure, you may receive oxygen therapy. Extra oxygen is given through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \n\n                \nOxygen also can be given through a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). This is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe.\n                \nTracheostomy\n                \n\n                \nIf the oxygen level in your blood doesn't increase, or if you're still having trouble breathing, your doctor may recommend a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.

This will help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. It also can prevent the machine's pressure from injuring your lungs. You'll use the ventilator until you can breathe on your own.\n                \nOther Treatments To Help You Breathe\n                \nNoninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and a rocking bed are two methods that can help you breathe better while you sleep. These methods are very useful for people who have chronic respiratory failure.\n                \nNPPV is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. You wear a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. A tube connects the mask to a machine, which blows air into the tube.\n                \nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is one type of NPPV. For more information, go to the Health Topics CPAP article. Although the article focuses on CPAP treatment for sleep apnea, it explains how CPAP works.\n                \nA rocking bed consists of a mattress on a motorized platform. The mattress gently rocks back and forth. When your head rocks down, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm (the main muscle used for breathing) slide up, helping you exhale. When your head rocks up, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm slide down, helping you inhale.\n                \nFluids\n                \nYou may be given fluids to improve blood flow throughout your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids.\n                \nToo much fluid can fill the lungs and make it hard for you to get the oxygen you need. Not enough fluid can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs.\n                \nFluids usually are given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted in one of your blood vessels.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to relieve discomfort.\n                \nTreatments for the Underlying Cause of Respiratory Failure\n                \nOnce your doctor figures out what's causing your respiratory failure, he or she will plan how to treat that disease or condition.

            "question": "What is (are) Sudden Cardiac Arrest ?",
            "answer": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. If this happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs.\n                \nSCA usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand SCA, it helps to understand how the heart works. The heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems with the heart's electrical system can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias.\n                \nThere are many types of arrhythmias. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some arrhythmias can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the bodythese arrhythmias cause SCA.\n                \nSCA is not the same as a heart attack. A heart attack occurs if blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. SCA, however, may happen after or during recovery from a heart attack.\n                \nPeople who have heart disease are at higher risk for SCA. However, SCA can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for SCA.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMost people who have SCA die from itoften within minutes. Rapid treatment of SCA with a defibrillator can be lifesaving. A defibrillator is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm.\n                \nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be used by bystanders to save the lives of people who are having SCA. These portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools."

            "question": "What causes Sudden Cardiac Arrest ?",
            "answer": "Ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) causes most sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs). V-fib is a type of arrhythmia.\n                \nDuring v-fib, the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they quiver very rapidly and irregularly. When this happens, the heart pumps little or no blood to the body. V-fib is fatal if not treated within a few minutes.\n                \nOther problems with the heart's electrical system also can cause SCA. For example, SCA can occur if the rate of the heart's electrical signals becomes very slow and stops. SCA also can occur if the heart muscle doesn't respond to the heart's electrical signals.\n                \nCertain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease; severe physical stress; certain inherited disorders; and structural changes in the heart.\n                \nSeveral research studies are under way to try to find the exact causes of SCA and how to prevent them.\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nCHD is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This may cause a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface.\n                \nA blood clot can partly or fully block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery. This causes a heart attack.\n                \nDuring a heart attack, some heart muscle cells die and are replaced with scar tissue. The scar tissue damages the heart's electrical system. As a result, electrical signals may spread abnormally throughout the heart. These changes to the heart increase the risk of dangerous arrhythmias and SCA.\n                \nCHD seems to cause most cases of SCA in adults. Many of these adults, however, have no signs or symptoms of CHD before having SCA.\n                \nPhysical Stress\n                \nCertain types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail. Examples include:\n                \nIntense physical activity. The hormone adrenaline is released during intense physical activity. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems.\n                \nVery low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical signaling.\n                \nMajor blood loss.\n                \nSevere lack of oxygen.\n                \nInherited Disorders\n                \nA tendency to have arrhythmias runs in some families. This tendency is inherited, which means it's passed from parents to children through the genes. Members of these families may be at higher risk for SCA.\n                \nAn example of an inherited disorder that makes you more likely to have arrhythmias is long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is a disorder of the heart's electrical activity. Problems with tiny pores on the surface of heart muscle cells cause the disorder. LQTS can cause sudden, uncontrollable, dangerous heart rhythms.\n                \nPeople who inherit structural heart problems also may be at higher risk for SCA. These types of problems often are the cause of SCA in children.\n                \nStructural Changes in the Heart\n                \nChanges in the heart's normal size or structure may affect its electrical system. Examples of such changes include an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections also may cause structural changes in the heart."

Most people who have SCA have some degree of coronary heart disease; however, many people may not know that they have coronary heart disease until SCA occurs. Usually their coronary heart disease is silentthat is, it has no signs or symptoms. Because of this, doctors and nurses have not detected it.\n                \nMany people who have SCA also have silent, or undiagnosed, heart attacks before sudden cardiac arrest happens.

            "answer": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Doctors rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, SCA often is diagnosed after it happens. Doctors do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you're at high risk for SCA, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. Your cardiologist will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA.\n                \nSome cardiologists specialize in problems with the heart's electrical system. These specialists are called cardiac electrophysiologists.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nDoctors use several tests to help detect the factors that put people at risk for SCA.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show evidence of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD). The test also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a cardiac stress test. During this test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nStress echo shows whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of CHD).\n                \nMUGA Test or Cardiac MRI\n                \nA MUGA (multiple gated acquisition) test shows how well your heart is pumping blood. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein and travels to your heart.\n                \nThe substance releases energy, which special cameras outside of your body can detect. The cameras use the energy to create pictures of many parts of your heart.\n                \nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a safe procedure that uses radio waves and magnets to create detailed pictures of your heart. The test creates still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\n                \nDoctors use cardiac MRI to get pictures of the beating heart and to look at the structure and function of the heart.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nCardiac catheterization is a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain heart conditions. A long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. Through the catheter, your doctor can do diagnostic tests and treatments on your heart.\n                \nSometimes dye is put into the catheter. The dye will flow through your bloodstream to your heart. The dye makes your coronary (heart) arteries visible on x-ray pictures. The dye can show whether plaque has narrowed or blocked any of your coronary arteries.\n                \nElectrophysiology Study\n                \nFor an electrophysiology study, doctors use cardiac catheterization to record how your heart's electrical system responds to certain medicines and electrical stimulation. This helps your doctor find where the heart's electrical system is damaged.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend blood tests to check the levels of potassium, magnesium, and other chemicals in your blood. These chemicals play an important role in your heart's electrical signaling."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Sudden Cardiac Arrest ?",
            "answer": "Emergency Treatment\n                \nSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. This device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating.\n                \nTo work well, defibrillation must be done within minutes of SCA. With every minute that passes, the chances of surviving SCA drop rapidly.\n                \nPolice, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders usually are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 911 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin.\n                \nAutomated External Defibrillators\n                \nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are special defibrillators that untrained bystanders can use. These portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools.\n                \nAEDs are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA.\n                \nYou should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.\n                \nPeople who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. A 2008 study by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institutes of Health found that AEDs in the home are safe and effective.\n                \nSome people feel that placing these devices in homes will save many lives because many SCAs occur at home.Others note that no evidence supports the idea that home-use AEDs save more lives. These people fear that people who have AEDs in their homes will delay calling for help during an emergency. They're also concerned that people who have home-use AEDs will not properly maintain the devices or forget where they are.\n                \nWhen considering a home-use AED, talk with your doctor. He or she can help you decide whether having an AED in your home will benefit you.\n                \nTreatment in a Hospital\n                \nIf you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.\n                \nWhile in the hospital, your medical team will try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary heart disease, you may havepercutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty,or coronary artery bypass grafting. These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\n                \nOften, people who have SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias.

            "question": "How to prevent Sudden Cardiac Arrest ?",
            "answer": "Ways to prevent death due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) differ depending on whether:\n                \nYou've already had SCA\n                \nYou've never had SCA but are at high risk for the condition\n                \nYou've never had SCA and have no known risk factors for the condition\n                \nFor People Who Have Survived Sudden Cardiac Arrest\n                \nIf you've already had SCA, you're at high risk of having it again. Research shows that an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chances of dying from a second SCA.An ICD is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. The device has wires with electrodes on the ends that connect to your heart's chambers. The ICD monitors your heartbeat.\n                \nIf the ICD detects a dangerous heart rhythm, it gives an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Your doctor may give you medicine to limit irregular heartbeats that can trigger the ICD.\n                \nImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator\n                \n\n                \nAn ICD isn't the same as a pacemaker. The devices are similar, but they have some differences. Pacemakers give off low-energy electrical pulses. They're often used to treat less dangerous heart rhythms, such as those that occur in the upper chambers of the heart. Most new ICDs work as both pacemakers and ICDs.\n                \nFor People at High Risk for a First Sudden Cardiac Arrest\n                \nIf you have severe coronary heart disease (CHD), you're at increased risk for SCA. This is especially true if you've recently had a heart attack.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe a type of medicine called a beta blocker to help lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may discuss beginning statin treatment if you have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHeart disease or had a prior stroke\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\n                \nLower blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\n                \nPrevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.\n                \nReduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.\n                \nOther treatments for coronary heart diseasesuch as percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graftingalso may lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may recommend an ICD if youre at high risk for SCA.\n                \nFor People Who Have No Known Risk Factors for Sudden Cardiac Arrest\n                \nCHD seems to be the cause of most SCAs in adults. CHD also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems.\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk for CHD, SCA, and other heart problems. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nHeart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nIf you eat:\n                \nTry to eat no more than:\n                \n1,200 calories a day              \n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day    \n                \n1,500 calories a day           \n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day           \n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day           \n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day           \n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nLimiting Alcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for sudden cardiac arrest. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight\n                \nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nManaging and coping with stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower your risk for coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nPeople who smoke are more likely to have a heart attack than are people who dont smoke. The risk of having a heart attack increases with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. Smoking also raises your risk for stroke and lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.\n                \nQuitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk for heart and lung diseases. Ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about how to quit smoking."

            "question": "What is (are) Pericarditis ?",
            "answer": "Pericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis) is a condition in which the membrane, or sac, around your heart is inflamed. This sac is called the pericardium (per-i-KAR-de-um).\n                \nThe pericardium holds the heart in place and helps it work properly. The sac is made of two thin layers of tissue that enclose your heart. Between the two layers is a small amount of fluid. This fluid keeps the layers from rubbing against each other and causing friction.\n                \nPericardium\n                \n\n                \nIn pericarditis, the layers of tissue become inflamed and can rub against the heart. This causes chest pain, a common symptom of pericarditis.\n                \nThe chest pain from pericarditis may feel like pain from a heart attack. More often, the pain may be sharp and get worse when you inhale, and improve when you are sitting up and leaning forward. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack.\n                \nOverview\n                \nIn many cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis, although the virus may never be found. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis.\n                \nOther possible causes include heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, and certain medicines.\n                \nPericarditis can be acute or chronic. \"Acute\" means that it occurs suddenly and usually doesn't last long. \"Chronic\" means that it develops over time and may take longer to treat.\n                \nBoth acute and chronic pericarditis can disrupt your heart's normal rhythm or function and possibly (although rarely) lead to death. However, most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment.\n                \nOther times, more intense treatments are needed to prevent complications. Treatments may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIt may take from a few days to weeks or even months to recover from pericarditis. With proper and prompt treatment, such as rest and ongoing care, most people fully recover from pericarditis. Proper treatment also can help reduce the chance of getting the condition again."

Pericarditis often occurs after a respiratory infection. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis.\n                \nMost cases of chronic, or recurring, pericarditis are thought to be the result of autoimmune disorders. Examples of such disorders include lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n                \nWith autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack the body's tissues or cells.\n                \nOther possible causes of pericarditis are:\n                \nHeart attack and heart surgery\n                \nKidney failure, HIV/AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis, and other health problems\n                \nInjuries from accidents or radiation therapy\n                \nCertain medicines, like phenytoin (an antiseizure medicine), warfarin and heparin (blood-thinning medicines), and procainamide (a medicine to treat irregular heartbeats)"

However, men aged 20 to 50 are more likely to develop it than others.\n                \nPeople who are treated for acute pericarditis may get it again. This may happen in 15 to 30 percent of people who have the condition. A small number of these people go on to develop chronic pericarditis."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the symptoms of Pericarditis ?",
            "answer": "The most common sign of acute pericarditis is sharp, stabbing chest pain. The pain usually comes on quickly. It often is felt in the middle or left side of the chest or over the front of the chest. You also may feel pain in one or both shoulders, the neck, back, and abdomen.\n                \nThe pain tends to ease when you sit up and lean forward. Lying down and deep breathing worsens it. For some people, the pain feels like a dull ache or pressure in the chest.\n                \nThe chest pain also may feel like pain from a heart attack. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack.\n                \nSome people with acute pericarditis develop a fever. Other symptoms are weakness, palpitations, trouble breathing, and coughing. (Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.)\n                \nThe most common symptom of chronic pericarditis is chest pain. Chronic pericarditis also often causes tiredness, coughing, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of chronic pericarditis can lead to swelling in the stomach and legs and hypotension (low blood pressure).\n                \nComplications of Pericarditis\n                \nTwo serious complications of pericarditis are cardiac tamponade (tam-po-NAD) and chronic constrictive pericarditis.\n                \nCardiac tamponade occurs if too much fluid collects in the pericardium (the sac around the heart). The extra fluid puts pressure on the heart. This prevents the heart from properly filling with blood. As a result, less blood leaves the heart, which causes a sharp drop in blood pressure. If left untreated, cardiac tamponade can be fatal.\n                \nChronic constrictive pericarditis is a rare disease that develops over time. It leads to scar-like tissue forming throughout the pericardium. The sac becomes stiff and can't move properly. In time, the scarred tissue compresses the heart and prevents it from working well."

            "question": "How to diagnose Pericarditis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose pericarditis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctorssuch as a family doctor, internist, or pediatricianoften diagnose and treat pericarditis. Other types of doctors also may be involved, such as a cardiologist, pediatric cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist.\n                \nA cardiologist treats adults who have heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist treats children who have heart problems. An infectious disease specialist treats people who have infections.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether you:\n                \nHave had a recent respiratory infection or flu-like illness\n                \nHave had a recent heart attack or injury to your chest\n                \nHave any other medical conditions\n                \nYour doctor also may ask about your symptoms. If you have chest pain, he or she will ask you to describe how it feels, where it's located, and whether it's worse when you lie down, breathe, or cough.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nWhen the pericardium (the sac around your heart) is inflamed, the amount of fluid between its two layers of tissue increases. As part of the exam, your doctor will look for signs of excess fluid in your chest.\n                \nA common sign is the pericardial rub. This is the sound of the pericardium rubbing against the outer layer of your heart. Your doctor will place a stethoscope on your chest to listen for this sound.\n                \nYour doctor may hear other chest sounds that are signs of fluid in the pericardium (pericardial effusion) or the lungs (pleural effusion). These are more severe problems related to pericarditis.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more tests to diagnose your condition and show how severe it is. The most common tests are:\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test detects and records your heart's electrical activity. Certain EKG results suggest pericarditis.\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show whether you have an enlarged heart. This is a sign of excess fluid in your pericardium.\n                \nEchocardiography. This painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is working. This test can show whether fluid has built up in the pericardium.\n                \nCardiac CT (computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee)). This is a type of x ray that takes a clear, detailed picture of your heart and pericardium. A cardiac CT helps rule out other causes of chest pain.\n                \nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. A cardiac MRI can show changes in the pericardium.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests. These tests can help your doctor find out whether you've had a heart attack, the cause of your pericarditis, and how inflamed your pericardium is."

Treatment may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery.\n                \nThe goals of treatment include:\n                \nReducing pain and inflammation\n                \nTreating the underlying cause, if it's known\n                \nChecking for complications\n                \nSpecific Types of Treatment\n                \nAs a first step in your treatment, your doctor may advise you to rest until you feel better and have no fever. He or she may tell you to take over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples of these medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.\n                \nYou may need stronger medicine if your pain is severe. If your pain continues to be severe, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine and, possibly, prednisone (a steroid medicine).\n                \nIf an infection is causing your pericarditis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or other medicine to treat the infection.\n                \nYou may need to stay in the hospital during treatment for pericarditis so your doctor can check you for complications.\n                \nThe symptoms of acute pericarditis can last from a few days to 3 weeks. Chronic pericarditis may last several months.\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nYou may need treatment for complications of pericarditis. Two serious complications are cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis.\n                \nCardiac tamponade is treated with a procedure called pericardiocentesis (per-ih-KAR-de-o-sen-TE-sis). A needle or tube (called a catheter) is inserted into the chest wall to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. This procedure relieves pressure on the heart.\n                \nThe only cure for chronic constrictive pericarditis is surgery to remove the pericardium. This is known as a pericardiectomy (PER-i-kar-de-EK-to-me).\n                \nThe treatments for these complications require hospital stays."

            "question": "What is (are) Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
            "answer": "Tetralogy (teh-TRAL-o-je) of Fallot (fah-LO) is a congenital heart defect. This is a problem with the heart's structure that's present at birth. Congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot is a rare, complex heart defect. It occurs in about 5out of every 10,000 babies. The defect affects boys and girls equally.\n                \nTo understand tetralogy of Fallot, it helps to know how a healthy heart works. The Health Topics How the Heart Works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart. The article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your heart's electrical system works.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot involves four heart defects:\n                \nA large ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n                \nPulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) stenosis\n                \nRight ventricular hypertrophy (hi-PER-tro-fe)\n                \nAn overriding aorta\n                \nVentricular Septal Defect\n                \nThe heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side. This wall is called a septum. The septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart.\n                \nA VSD is a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles. The hole allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle.\n                \nPulmonary Stenosis\n                \nThis defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.\n                \nNormally, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery. From there, the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n                \nIn pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve cannot fully open. Thus, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. As a result, not enough blood reaches the lungs.\n                \nRight Ventricular Hypertrophy\n                \nWith this defect, the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual. This occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve.\n                \nOverriding Aorta\n                \nThis defect occurs in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. In a healthy heart, the aorta is attached to the left ventricle. This allows only oxygen-rich blood to flow to the body.\n                \nIn tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles, directly over the VSD. As a result, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nWith tetralogy of Fallot, not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen, and oxygen-poor blood flows to the body.\n                \nCross-Section of a Normal Heart and a Heart With Tetralogy of Fallot\n                \n\n                \nBabies and children who have tetralogy of Fallot have episodes of cyanosis (si-ah-NO-sis). Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal.\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is.\n                \nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of Fallot have greatly improved. Most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood. However, they'll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible."

            "question": "What causes Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
            "answer": "Doctors often don't know what causes tetralogy of Fallot and other congenital heart defects.\n                \nSome conditions or factors that occur during pregnancy may raise your risk of having a child who has tetralogy of Fallot. These conditions and factors include:\n                \nGerman measles (rubella) and some other viral illnesses\n                \nPoor nutrition\n                \nAlcohol use\n                \nAge (being older than 40)\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHeredity may play a role in causing tetralogy of Fallot. An adult who has tetralogy of Fallot may be more likely than other people to have a baby with the condition.\n                \nChildren who have certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, often have congenital heart defects, including tetralogy of Fallot.\n                \nResearchers continue to search for the causes of tetralogy of Fallot and other congenital heart defects."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
            "answer": "Cyanosis is an important sign of tetralogy of Fallot. Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. Low oxygen levels in the blood cause cyanosis.\n                \nBabies who have unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot sometimes have \"tet spells.\" These spells happen in response to an activity like crying or having a bowel movement.\n                \nA tet spell occurs when the oxygen level in the blood suddenly drops. This causes the baby to become very blue. The baby also may:\n                \nHave a hard time breathing\n                \nBecome very tired and limp\n                \nNot respond to a parent's voice or touch\n                \nBecome very fussy\n                \nPass out\n                \nIn years past, when tetralogy of Fallot wasn't treated in infancy, children would get very tired during exercise and could faint. Now, doctors repair tetralogy of Fallot in infancy to prevent these symptoms.\n                \nAnother common sign of tetralogy of Fallot is a heart murmur. A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound that doctors might hear while listening to the heart.\n                \nThe sound occurs because the heart defect causes abnormal blood flow through the heart. However, not all heart murmurs are signs of congenital heart defects. Many healthy children have heart murmurs.\n                \nBabies who have tetralogy of Fallot may tire easily while feeding. Thus, they may not gain weight or grow as quickly as children who have healthy hearts. Also, normal growth depends on a normal workload for the heart and normal flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body.\n                \nChildren who have tetralogy of Fallot also may have clubbing. Clubbing is the widening or rounding of the skin or bone around the tips of the fingers."

            "question": "How to diagnose Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
            "answer": "Doctors diagnose tetralogy of Fallot based on a baby's signs and symptoms, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of the heart defect usually occur during the first weeks of life. Your infant's doctor may notice signs or symptoms during a routine checkup. Some parents also notice cyanosis or poor feeding and bring the baby to the doctor. (Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails.)\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf your child has tetralogy of Fallot, a pediatric cardiologist and pediatric cardiac surgeon may be involved in his or her care.\n                \nA pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children. Pediatric cardiac surgeons repair children's heart defects using surgery.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring a physical exam, the doctor may:\n                \nListen to your baby's heart and lungs with a stethoscope.\n                \nLook for signs of a heart defect, such as a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails and rapid breathing.\n                \nLook at your baby's general appearance. Some children who have tetralogy of Fallot also have DiGeorge syndrome. This syndrome causes characteristic facial traits, such as wide-set eyes.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour child's doctor may recommend several tests to diagnose tetralogy of Fallot. These tests can provide information about the four heart defects that occur in tetralogy of Fallot and how serious they are.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. During the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.\n                \nEcho allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.\n                \nEcho is an important test for diagnosing tetralogy of Fallot because it shows the four heart defects and how the heart is responding to them. This test helps the cardiologist decide when to repair the defects and what type of surgery to use.\n                \nEcho also is used to check a child's condition over time, after the defects have been repaired.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nThis test can help the doctor find out whether your child's right ventricle is enlarged (ventricular hypertrophy).\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether the heart is enlarged or whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.\n                \nPulse Oximetry\n                \nFor this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). The sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart.\n                \nSpecial dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the heart's chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.\n                \nThe doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
            "answer": "Tetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The goal of surgery is to repair the four defects of tetralogy of Fallot so the heart can work as normally as possible. Repairing the defects can greatly improve a child's health and quality of life.\n                \nThe pediatric cardiologist and cardiac surgeon will decide the best time to do the surgery. They will base their decision on your baby's health and weight and the severity of the defects and symptoms.\n                \nSome teenagers or adults who had tetralogy of Fallot repaired in childhood need additional surgery to correct heart problems that develop over time. For more information, go to \"Living With Tetralogy of Fallot.\"\n                \nTypes of Surgery\n                \nComplete Intracardiac Repair\n                \nSurgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot improves blood flow to the lungs. Surgery also ensures that oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood flow to the right places.\n                \nThe surgeon will:\n                \nWiden the narrowed pulmonary blood vessels. The pulmonary valve is widened or replaced. Also, the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery is enlarged. These procedures improve blood flow to the lungs. This allows the blood to get enough oxygen to meet the body's needs.\n                \nRepair the ventricular septal defect (VSD). A patch is used to cover the hole in the septum. This patch stops oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood from mixing between the ventricles.\n                \nFixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects. When the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs, it will return to a normal thickness. Fixing the VSD means that only oxygen-rich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta.\n                \nThe incision (cut) that the surgeon makes to reach the heart usually heals in about 6weeks. The surgeon or a hospital staff member will explain when it's okay to give your baby a bath, pick him or her up under the arms, and take your baby for regular shots (immunizations).\n                \nTemporary or Palliative Surgery\n                \nIt was common in the past to do temporary surgery during infancy for tetralogy of Fallot. This surgery improved blood flow to the lungs. A complete repair of the four defects was done later in childhood.\n                \nNow, tetralogy of Fallot usually is fully repaired in infancy. However, some babies are too weak or too small to have the full repair. They must have temporary surgery first. This surgery improves oxygen levels in the blood. The surgery also gives the baby time to grow and get strong enough for the full repair.\n                \nFor temporary surgery, the surgeon places a tube between a large artery branching off the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The tube is called a shunt. One end of the shunt is sewn to the artery branching off the aorta. The other end is sewn to the pulmonary artery.\n                \nThe shunt creates an additional pathway for blood to travel to the lungs to get oxygen. The surgeon removes the shunt when the baby's heart defects are fixed during the full repair.\n                \nAfter temporary surgery, your baby may need medicines to keep the shunt open while waiting for the full repair. These medicines are stopped after the surgeon removes the shunt."

            "question": "What is (are) Asthma ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nAsthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.\n                \nAsthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7million of these people are children.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances.\n                \nWhen the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.\n                \nThis chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed.\n                \nAsthma\n                \n\n                \nSometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse.\n                \nWhen symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns).\n                \nTreating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAsthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time.\n                \nHowever, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma.\n                \nIf you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers."

These factors include:\n                \nAn inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe)\n                \nParents who have asthma\n                \nCertain respiratory infections during childhood\n                \nContact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing\n                \nIf asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air.\n                \nSome factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. Researchers continue to explore what causes asthma.\n                \nThe \"Hygiene Hypothesis\"\n                \nOne theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" They believe that our Western lifestylewith its emphasis on hygiene and sanitationhas resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood.\n                \nMany young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. This affects the way that young children's immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. This is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions."

These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).\n                \nKeep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nLung Function Test\n                \nYour doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out.\n                \nYour doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved.\n                \nIf the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include:\n                \nAllergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any.\n                \nA test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in.\n                \nA test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea.\n                \nA chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms.\n                \nDiagnosing Asthma in Young Children\n                \nMost children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose.\n                \nSometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions.\n                \nAlso, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old.\n                \nA child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds.\n                \nA young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if:\n                \nOne or both parents have asthma\n                \nThe child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema\n                \nThe child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens\n                \nThe child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection\n                \nThe most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis.\n                \nDoctors also may use a 46 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Asthma ?",
            "answer": "Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will:\n                \nPrevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath\n                \nReduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below)\n                \nHelp you maintain good lung function\n                \nLet you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night\n                \nPrevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay\n                \nTo control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child's asthma. Children aged 10 or olderand younger children who are ableshould take an active role in their asthma care.\n                \nTaking an active role to control your asthma involves:\n                \nWorking with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management.\n                \nAvoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.\n                \nWorking with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan.\n                \nAn asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed.\n                \nAsthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or \"rescue,\" medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up.\n                \nYour initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks.\n                \nYour level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma.\n                \nYour doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary.\n                \nAsthma treatment for certain groups of peoplesuch as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptomswill be adjusted to meet their special needs.\n                \nFollow an Asthma Action Plan\n                \nYou can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room.\n                \nIf your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan.\n                \nGo to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Asthma Action Plan\" for a sample plan.\n                \nAvoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma\n                \nMany common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\")\n                \nFor example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom.\n                \nOne possible asthma trigger you shouldnt avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.\n                \nThe NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI's \"Asthma Action Plan.\"\n                \nIf your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots.\n                \nYou may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can't cure your asthma.\n                \nSeveral health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed.\n                \nAsthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs.\n                \nNot all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit.\n                \nLong-Term Control Medicines\n                \nMost people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms.\n                \nInhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances.\n                \nReducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur.\n                \nInhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years.\n                \nLike many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects.\n                \nOne common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat.\n                \nCheck with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush.\n                \nIf you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control.\n                \nIf taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break.\n                \nYour doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones.\n                \nOther long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include:\n                \nCromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation.\n                \nOmalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well.\n                \nA rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take.\n                \nInhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids.\n                \nLeukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways.\n                \nTheophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways.\n                \nIf your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine.\n                \nLong-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them.\n                \nWith some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that youre getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects.\n                \nQuick-Relief Medicines\n                \nAll people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief.\n                \nThese medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them.\n                \nYou should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan.\n                \nCarry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child's school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child.\n                \nYou shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation.\n                \nTrack Your Asthma\n                \nTo track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups.\n                \nRecord Your Symptoms\n                \nYou can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma.\n                \nAsthma is well controlled if:\n                \nYou have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month.\n                \nYou can do all your normal activities.\n                \nYou take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week.\n                \nYou have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth.\n                \nYour peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number.\n                \nIf your asthma isn't well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan.\n                \nUse a Peak Flow Meter\n                \nThis small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test.\n                \nYour doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score.\n                \nYour doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you.\n                \nWhen you're first diagnosed with asthma, it's important to find your \"personal best\" peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled.\n                \nYour peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked.\n                \nGet Asthma Checkups\n                \nWhen you first begin treatment, you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year.\n                \nDuring these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine.\n                \nIf your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma.\n                \nEmergency Care\n                \nMost people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times.\n                \nCall your doctor for advice if:\n                \nYour medicines don't relieve an asthma attack.\n                \nYour peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number.\n                \nCall 911 for emergency care if:\n                \nYou have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath.\n                \nYou have blue lips or fingernails.\n                \nAt the hospital, you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life.\n                \nAsthma Treatment for Special Groups\n                \nThe treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs.\n                \nChildren\n                \nIt's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.)\n                \nDoctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to \"How Is Asthma Diagnosed?\")\n                \nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly.\n                \nInhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn't get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate.\n                \nMany experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth.\n                \nOlder Adults\n                \nDoctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms.\n                \nBe sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.\n                \nOlder adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong.\n                \nPregnant Women\n                \nPregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight.\n                \nStudies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack.\n                \nTalk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed.\n                \nPeople Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity\n                \nPhysical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development.\n                \nIn some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active.\n                \nThe following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity:\n                \nShort-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them.\n                \nLong-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled.\n                \nLeukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity.\n                \nLong-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms.\n                \nEasing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather.\n                \nIf you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose.\n                \nPeople Having Surgery\n                \nAsthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack.\n                \nTell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery."

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance thats found in all cells of the body.\n                \nYour body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs.

These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside.\n                \nTwo kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important.\n                \nLDL cholesterol sometimes is called bad cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.)\n                \nHDL cholesterol sometimes is called good cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.\n                \nWhat Is High Blood Cholesterol?\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much cholesterol in your blood. By itself, the condition usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people dont know that their cholesterol levels are too high.\n                \nPeople who have high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. (In this article, the term heart disease refers to coronary heart disease.)\n                \nThe higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the GREATER your chance is of getting heart disease. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease.\n                \nCoronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nAtherosclerosis\n                \n\n                \nOver time, plaque hardens and narrows your coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIf the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack may occur.\n                \nAngina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also may occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\n                \nA heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious problems or death.\n                \nPlaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, such as the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nLowering your cholesterol may slow, reduce, or even stop the buildup of plaque in your arteries. It also may reduce the risk of plaque rupturing and causing dangerous blood clots.\n                \n\n                \nSources: National Center for Health Statistics (20072010).

            "question": "What causes High Blood Cholesterol ?",
            "answer": "Many factors can affect the cholesterol levels in your blood. You can control some factors, but not others.\n                \nFactors You Can Control\n                \nDiet\n                \nCholesterol is found in foods that come from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. Some foods have fats that raise your cholesterol level.\n                \nFor example, saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level more than anything else in your diet. Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\n                \nTrans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it. Trans fats are found in some fried and processed foods.\n                \nLimiting foods with cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fats can help you control your cholesterol levels.\n                \nPhysical Activity and Weight\n                \nLack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level. (Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including LDL and HDL.)\n                \nRoutine physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your LDL cholesterol. Being physically active also can help you raise your HDL cholesterol level.\n                \nFactors You Cant Control\n                \nHeredity\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol can run in families. An inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia causes very high LDL cholesterol. (Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) This condition begins at birth, and it may cause a heart attack at an early age.\n                \nAge and Sex\n                \nStarting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, afterage 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men."

Thus, many people don't know that their cholesterol levels are too high.\n                \nIf you're 20 years old or older, have your cholesterol levels checked at least once every 5 years. Talk with your doctor about how often you should be tested."

            "question": "How to diagnose High Blood Cholesterol ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose high blood cholesterol by checking the cholesterol levels in your blood. A blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, youll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours.\n                \nThe lipoprotein panel will give your doctor information about your:\n                \nTotal cholesterol. Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n                \nLDL cholesterol. LDL, or bad, cholesterol is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries.\n                \nHDL cholesterol. HDL, or good, cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nTriglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in women.\n                \nIf its not possible to have a lipoprotein panel, knowing your total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol can give you a general idea about your cholesterol levels.\n                \nTesting for total and HDL cholesterol does not require fasting. If your total cholesterol is 200 mg/dL or more, or if your HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL, your doctor will likely recommend that you have a lipoprotein panel. (Cholesterol is measured as milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood.)\n                \nThe tables below show total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels and their corresponding categories. See how your cholesterol numbers compare to the numbers in the tables below.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nTriglycerides also can raise your risk for heart disease. If your triglyceride level is borderline high (150199 mg/dL) or high (200 mg/dL or higher), you may need treatment.\n                \nFactors that can raise your triglyceride level include:\n                \nOverweight and obesity\n                \nLack of physical activity\n                \nCigarette smoking\n                \nExcessive alcohol use\n                \nA very high carbohydrate diet\n                \nCertain diseases and medicines\n                \nSome genetic disorders"

            "question": "What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?",
            "answer": "High blood cholesterol is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. The main goal of treatment is to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk for coronary heart disease, heart attack, and other related health problems.\n                \nYour risk for heart disease and heart attack goes up as your LDL cholesterol level rises and your number of heart disease risk factors increases.\n                \nSome people are at high risk for heart attacks because they already have heart disease. Other people are at high risk for heart disease because they have diabetes or more than one heart disease risk factor.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about lowering your cholesterol and your risk for heart disease. Also, check the list to find out whether you have risk factors that affect your LDL cholesterol goal:\n                \nCigarette smoking\n                \nHigh blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or higher), or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure\n                \nLow high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL)\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease (heart disease in father or brother before age 55; heart disease in mother or sister before age 65)\n                \nAge (men 45 years or older; women 55 years or older)\n                \nYou can use the NHLBI 10-Year Risk Calculator to find your risk score. The score, given as a percentage, refers to your chance of having a heart attack in the next 10years.\n                \nBased on your medical history, number of risk factors, and risk score, figure out your risk of getting heart disease or having a heart attack using the table below.\n                \n* Some people in this category are at very high risk because theyve just had a heart attack or they have diabetes and heart disease, severe risk factors, or metabolic syndrome. If youre at very high risk, your doctor may set your LDL goal even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL. Your doctor also may set your LDL goal at this lower level if you have heart disease alone.\n                \nAfter following the above steps, you should have an idea about your risk for heart disease and heart attack. The two main ways to lower your cholesterol (and, thus, your heart disease risk) include:\n                \nTherapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). TLC is a three-part program that includes a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. TLC is for anyone whose LDL cholesterol level is above goal.\n                \nMedicines. If cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, theyre used with the TLC program to help lower your LDL cholesterol level.\n                \nYour doctor will set your LDL goal. The higher your risk for heart disease, the lower he or she will set your LDL goal. Using the following guide, you and your doctor can create a plan for treating your high blood cholesterol.\n                \nCategory I, high risk, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.*\n                \n* Your LDL goal may be set even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL, if youre at very high risk or if you have heart disease. If you have this lower goal and your LDL is 70 mg/dL or higher, youll need to begin the TLC diet and take medicines as prescribed.\n                \nCategory II, moderately high risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL\n                \nCategory III, moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.\n                \nCategory IV, low to moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.\n                \n\n                \nLowering Cholesterol Using Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes\n                \n\n                \nTLC is a set of lifestyle changes that can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. The main parts of the TLC program are a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity.\n                \nThe TLC Diet\n                \nWith the TLC diet, less than 7 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\n                \nNo more than 25 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, trans, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats.\n                \nYou also should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol and the types of fat in prepared foods can be found on the foods' Nutrition Facts labels.\n                \nFoods high in soluble fiber also are part of the TLC diet. They help prevent the digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include:\n                \nWhole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran\n                \nFruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber.\n                \nA healthy diet also includes some types of fish, such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. These fish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may help protect the heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce the risk of heart attack. Try to have about two fish meals every week.\n                \nYou also should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat. This means choosing low-salt and \"no added salt\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. The Nutrition Facts label on food packaging shows the amount of sodium in the item.\n                \nTry to limit drinks with alcohol. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. (Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.) Alcohol also adds extra calories, which will cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.\n                \nFor more information about TLC, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol With TLC.\"\n                \nWeight Management\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower LDL cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important if you have a condition called metabolic syndrome.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nThe five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol level.\n                \nPeople gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nCholesterol-Lowering Medicines\n                \nIn addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Even with medicines, you should continue the TLC program.\n                \nMedicines can help control high blood cholesterol, but they dont cure it. Thus, you must continue taking your medicine to keep your cholesterol level in the recommended range.\n                \nThe five major types of cholesterol-lowering medicines are statins, bile acid sequestrants (seh-KWES-trants), nicotinic (nick-o-TIN-ick) acid, fibrates, and ezetimibe.\n                \nStatins work well at lowering LDL cholesterol. These medicines are safe for most people. Rare side effects include muscle and liver problems.\n                \nBile acid sequestrants also help lower LDL cholesterol. These medicines usually arent prescribed as the only medicine to lower cholesterol. Sometimes theyre prescribed with statins.\n                \nNicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. You should only use this type of medicine with a doctors supervision.\n                \nFibrates lower triglycerides, and they may raise HDL cholesterol. When used with statins, fibrates may increase the risk of muscle problems.\n                \nEzetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol. This medicine works by blocking the intestine from absorbing cholesterol.\n                \nWhile youre being treated for high blood cholesterol, youll need ongoing care. Your doctor will want to make sure your cholesterol levels are controlled. He or she also will want to check for other health problems.\n                \nIf needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines for other health problems. Take all medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. The combination of medicines may lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack.\n                \nWhile trying to manage your cholesterol, take steps to manage other heart disease risk factors too. For example, if you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to lower it.\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Your doctor can help you create a reasonable weight-loss plan."

            "question": "What is (are) Hypotension ?",
            "answer": "Hypotension (HI-po-TEN-shun) is abnormally low blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.\n                \nBlood pressure is measured as systolic (sis-TOL-ik) and diastolic (di-a-STOL-ik) pressures. \"Systolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. \"Diastolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.\n                \nYou most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number, such as 120/80 mmHg. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nNormal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmHg. Hypotension is blood pressure that's lower than 90/60 mmHg.\n                \nOverview\n                \nBlood pressure doesn't stay the same all the time. It lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up. Blood pressure also rises when you're excited, nervous, or active.\n                \nYour body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure. For example, if you stand up quickly, your blood pressure may drop for a short time. Your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.\n                \nMost forms of hypotension happen because your body can't bring blood pressure back to normal or can't do it fast enough.\n                \nSome people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no signs or symptoms, and their low blood pressure is normal for them.\n                \nIn other people, certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure. As a result, less blood and oxygen flow to the body's organs.\n                \nFor the most part, hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition, such as heart disease. Signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness, fainting, cold and sweaty skin, fatigue (tiredness), blurred vision, or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).\n                \nIn extreme cases, hypotension can lead to shock.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment. If it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that's causing it.\n                \nHypotension can be dangerous. It can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. Shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that's often fatal if not treated right away. With prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated."

            "question": "What causes Hypotension ?",
            "answer": "Conditions or factors that disrupt the body's ability to control blood pressure cause hypotension. The different types of hypotension have different causes.\n                \nOrthostatic Hypotension\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension has many causes. Sometimes two or more factors combine to cause this type of low blood pressure.\n                \nDehydration (de-hi-DRA-shun) is the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension. Dehydration occurs if the body loses more water than it takes in.\n                \nYou may become dehydrated if you don't drink enough fluids or if you sweat a lot during physical activity. Fever, vomiting, and severe diarrhea also can cause dehydration.\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension also may occur during pregnancy, but it usually goes away after birth.\n                \nBecause an older body doesn't manage changes in blood pressure as well as a younger body, getting older also can lead to this type of hypotension.\n                \nPostprandial hypotension (a type of orthostatic hypotension) mostly affects older adults. Postprandial hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure after a meal.\n                \nCertain medical conditions can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension, including:\n                \nHeart conditions, such as heart attack, heart valve disease, bradycardia (a very low heart rate), and heart failure. These conditions prevent the heart from pumping enough blood to the body.\n                \nAnemia.\n                \nSevere infections.\n                \nEndocrine conditions, such as thyroid disorders, Addison's disease, low blood sugar, and diabetes.\n                \nCentral nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\n                \nPulmonary embolism.\n                \nSome medicines for high blood pressure and heart disease can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension. These medicines include:\n                \nDiuretics, also called \"water pills\"\n                \nCalcium channel blockers\n                \nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n                \nAngiotensin II receptor blockers\n                \nNitrates\n                \nBeta blockers\n                \nMedicines for conditions such as anxiety, depression, erectile dysfunction, and central nervous system disorders also can increase your risk of orthostatic hypotension.\n                \nOther substances, when taken with high blood pressure medicines, also can lead to orthostatic hypotension. These substances include alcohol, barbiturates, and some prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n                \nFinally, other factors or conditions that can trigger orthostatic hypotension include being out in the heat or being immobile for a long time. \"Immobile\" means you can't move around very much.\n                \nNeurally Mediated Hypotension\n                \nNeurally mediated hypotension (NMH) occurs when the brain and heart don't communicate with each other properly.\n                \nFor example, when you stand for a long time, blood begins to pool in your legs. This causes your blood pressure to drop. In NMH, the body mistakenly tells the brain that blood pressure is high. In response, the brain slows the heart rate. This makes blood pressure drop even more, causing dizziness and other symptoms.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nMany factors and conditions can cause severe hypotension linked to shock. Some of these factors also can cause orthostatic hypotension. In shock, though, blood pressure drops very low and doesn't return to normal on its own.\n                \nShock is an emergency and must be treated right away. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911.\n                \nSome severe infections can cause shock. This is known as septic shock. It can occur if bacteria enter the bloodstream. The bacteria release a toxin (poison) that leads to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.\n                \nA severe loss of blood or fluids from the body also can cause shock. This is known as hypovolemic (HI-po-vo-LE-mik) shock. Hypovolemic shock can happen as a result of:\n                \nMajor external bleeding (for example, from a severe cut or injury)\n                \nMajor internal bleeding (for example, from a ruptured blood vessel or injury that causes bleeding inside the body)\n                \nMajor loss of body fluids from severe burns\n                \nSevere swelling of the pancreas (an organ that produces enzymes and hormones, such as insulin)\n                \nSevere diarrhea\n                \nSevere kidney disease\n                \nOveruse of diuretics\n                \nA major decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood also can cause shock. This is known as cardiogenic (KAR-de-o-JEN-ik) shock.\n                \nA heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or an ongoing arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah) that disrupts heart function can cause this type of shock.\n                \nA sudden and extreme relaxation of the arteries linked to a drop in blood pressure also can cause shock. This is known as vasodilatory (VA-so-DI-la-tory) shock. It can occur due to:\n                \nA severe head injury\n                \nA reaction to certain medicines\n                \nLiver failure\n                \nPoisoning\n                \nA severe allergic reaction (called anaphylactic (AN-a-fi-LAK-tik) shock)"

            "answer": "Hypotension can affect people of all ages. However, people in certain age groups are more likely to have certain types of hypotension.\n                \nOlder adults are more likely to have orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. Children and young adults are more likely to have neurally mediated hypotension.\n                \nPeople who take certain medicinessuch as diuretics (\"water pills\") or other high blood pressure medicinesare at increased risk for hypotension. Certain conditions also increase the risk for hypotension. Examples include central nervous system disorders (such as Parkinson's disease) and some heart conditions.\n                \nOther risk factors for hypotension include being immobile (not being able to move around very much) for long periods, being out in the heat for a long time, and pregnancy. Hypotension during pregnancy is normal and usually goes away after birth."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Hypotension ?",
            "answer": "Orthostatic Hypotension and Neurally Mediated Hypotension\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) are similar. They include:\n                \nDizziness or light-headedness\n                \nBlurry vision\n                \nConfusion\n                \nWeakness\n                \nFatigue (feeling tired)\n                \nNausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension may happen within a few seconds or minutes of standing up after you've been sitting or lying down.\n                \nYou may feel that you're going to faint, or you may actually faint. These signs and symptoms go away if you sit or lie down for a few minutes until your blood pressure adjusts to normal.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of NMH occur after standing for a long time or in response to an unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situation. The drop in blood pressure with NMH doesn't last long and often goes away after sitting down.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nIn shock, not enough blood and oxygen flow to the body's major organs, including the brain. The early signs and symptoms of reduced blood flow to the brain include light-headedness, sleepiness, and confusion.\n                \nIn the earliest stages of shock, it may be hard to detect any signs or symptoms. In older people, the first symptom may only be confusion.\n                \nOver time, as shock worsens, a person won't be able to sit up without passing out. If the shock continues, the person will lose consciousness. Shock often is fatal if not treated right away.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of shock vary, depending on what's causing the shock. When low blood volume (from major blood loss, for example) or poor pumping action in the heart (from heart failure, for example) causes shock:\n                \nThe skin becomes cold and sweaty. It often looks blue or pale. If pressed, the color returns to normal more slowly than usual. A bluish network of lines appears under the skin.\n                \nThe pulse becomes weak and rapid.\n                \nThe person begins to breathe very quickly.\n                \nWhen extreme relaxation of blood vessels causes shock (such as in vasodilatory shock), a person feels warm and flushed at first. Later, the skin becomes cold and sweaty, and the person feels very sleepy.\n                \nShock is an emergency and must be treated right away. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911."

            "question": "How to diagnose Hypotension ?",
            "answer": "Hypotension is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to know:\n                \nThe type of hypotension you have and how severe it is\n                \nWhether an underlying condition is causing the hypotension\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nA primary care doctor or specialist may diagnose and treat hypotension. The type of specialist most commonly involved is a cardiologist (heart specialist).\n                \nOther specialists also may be involved, such as surgeons, nephrologists (kidney specialists), or neurologists (brain and nerve specialists).\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nShock is a life-threatening condition that requires emergency treatment. For other types of hypotension, your doctor may recommend tests to find out how your blood pressure responds in certain situations.\n                \nThe test results will help your doctor understand why you're fainting or having other symptoms.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nDuring a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\n                \nBlood tests can show whether anemia or low blood sugar is causing your hypotension.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG also shows the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nHolter and event monitors are medical devices that record your heart's electrical activity. These monitors are similar to an EKG. However, a standard EKG only records your heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't occur during the test.\n                \nHolter and event monitors are small, portable devices. You can wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for longer periods than a standard EKG.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done as part of a stress test (see below). Stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease (also called coronary artery disease).\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.\n                \nThese tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.\n                \nValsalva Maneuver\n                \nThis is a simple test for the part of your nervous system that controls functions such as your heartbeat and the narrowing and widening of your blood vessels. If something goes wrong with this part of the nervous system, blood pressure problems may occur.\n                \nDuring this test, you take a deep breath and then force the air out through your lips. You will do this several times. Your heart rate and blood pressure will be checked during the test.\n                \nTilt Table Test\n                \nThis test is used if you have fainting spells for no known reason. For the test, you lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position. Your doctor checks your reaction to the change in position.\n                \nDoctors use a tilt table test to diagnose orthostatic hypotension and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH). People who have NMH usually faint during this test. The test can help your doctor find any underlying brain or nerve condition."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Hypotension ?",
            "answer": "Treatment depends on the type of hypotension you have and the severity of your signs and symptoms. The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.\n                \nYour response to treatment depends on your age, overall health, and strength. It also depends on how easily you can stop, start, or change medicines.\n                \nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment.\n                \nIf you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don't go away quickly, you should seek medical care.\n                \nOrthostatic Hypotension\n                \nMany treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\n                \nDrinking little or no alcohol.\n                \nStanding up slowly.\n                \nNot crossing your legs while sitting.\n                \nSlowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you've been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term \"immobile\" refers to not being able to move around very much.\n                \nEating small, low-carbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension).\n                \nTalk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body.\n                \nIf medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take.\n                \nSeveral medicines are used to treat orthostatic hypotension. These medicines, which raise blood pressure, include fludrocortisone and midodrine.\n                \nNeurally Mediated Hypotension\n                \nIf you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include:\n                \nAvoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms.\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\n                \nIncreasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises).\n                \nLearning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure.\n                \nIf medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH.\n                \nChildren who have NHM often outgrow it.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nShock is a life-threatening emergency. People who have shock need prompt treatment from medical personnel. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911 right away.\n                \nThe goals of treating shock are to:\n                \nRestore blood flow to the organs as quickly as possible to prevent organ damage\n                \nFind and reverse the cause of shock\n                \nBlood or special fluids are put into the bloodstream to restore blood flow to the organs. Medicines can help raise blood pressure or make the heartbeat stronger. Depending on the cause of the shock, other treatmentssuch as antibiotics or surgerymay be needed."

            "question": "What is (are) Pulmonary Hypertension ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), or PH, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen.\n                \nPH causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. As the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand PH, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. Your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum.\n                \nEach side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. The lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. The blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen.\n                \nThe upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (AY-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. The blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta.\n                \nFor more information about the heart and lungs, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works and How the Lungs Work articles.\n                \nPH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if:\n                \nThe walls of the arteries tighten.\n                \nThe walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells.\n                \nBlood clots form in the arteries.\n                \nThese changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. As a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. Also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak.\n                \nYour heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. This causes heart failure. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have PH.\n                \nPH is divided into five groups based on its causes. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 820 mmHg at rest. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nOther diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause PH. Some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for PH on to them). In some cases, the cause isn't known.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPH has no cure. However, research for new treatments is ongoing. The earlier PH is treated, the easier it is to control.\n                \nTreatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. These treatments can relieve PH symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms."

            "question": "How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nPH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms.\n                \nWhen symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH.\n                \nYour doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH.\n                \nTests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis\n                \nEchocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working.\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged.\n                \nThe pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries.\n                \nA chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained.\n                \nRight heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart.\n                \nTests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nPH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause.\n                \nChest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH.\n                \nChest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH.\n                \nLung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH.\n                \nPolysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse.\n                \nA PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article.\n                \nLung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels.\n                \nBlood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis).\n                \nFinding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nExercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n                \nA 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle.\n                \nDuring exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4.\n                \nClass 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.\n                \nClass 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms.\n                \nClass 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms.\n                \nClass 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest.\n                \nOver time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Pulmonary Hypertension ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.\n                \nPH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\")\n                \nGroup 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\n                \nGroup 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.\n                \nExamples of medicines for group 1 PAH include:\n                \nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil\n                \nProstanoids, such as epoprostenol\n                \nEndothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan\n                \nCalcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization.\n                \nMedical and Surgical Procedures\n                \nIf you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures.\n                \nAtrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum.\n                \nA tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States.\n                \nLung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH.\n                \nHeartlung transplant. A heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor.\n                \nGroup 2 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nConditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery.\n                \nGroup 3 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nLung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH.\n                \nIf you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease.\n                \nGroup 4 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nBlood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nSometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots.\n                \nGroup 5 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nVarious diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH.\n                \nGroup 5 PH is treated by treating its cause.\n                \nAll Types of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nSeveral treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include:\n                \nDiuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet.\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nDigoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur.\n                \nOxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood.\n                \nPhysical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future."

            "question": "What is (are) Aplastic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Aplastic anemia (a-PLAS-tik uh-NEE-me-uh) is a blood disorder in which the body's bone marrow doesn't make enough new blood cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets).\n                \nRed blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste product) to your lungs to be exhaled. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nIt's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than a day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.\n                \nIf your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells, many health problems can occur. These problems include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, heart failure, infections, and bleeding. Severe aplastic anemia can even cause death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nAplastic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). This iron-rich protein helps carry oxygen to your body.\n                \nIn people who have aplastic anemia, the body doesn't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is because the bone marrow's stem cells are damaged. (Aplastic anemia also is called bone marrow failure.)\n                \nMany diseases, conditions, and factors can damage the stem cells. These conditions can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.\n                \nIn many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAplastic anemia is a rare but serious disorder. It can develop suddenly or slowly. The disorder tends to get worse over time, unless its cause is found and treated. Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines.\n                \nWith prompt and proper care, many people who have aplastic anemia can be successfully treated. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may offer a cure for some people who have aplastic anemia."

Inherited aplastic anemia is rare.\n                \nIn many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown. Some research suggests that stem cell damage may occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake.\n                \nAcquired Causes\n                \nMany diseases, conditions, and factors can cause aplastic anemia, including:\n                \nToxins, such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene.\n                \nRadiation and chemotherapy (treatments for cancer).\n                \nMedicines, such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic rarely used in the United States).\n                \nInfectious diseases, such as hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (si-to-MEG-ah-lo-VI-rus), parvovirus B19, and HIV.\n                \nAutoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n                \nPregnancy. (Aplastic anemia that occurs during pregnancy often goes away after delivery.)\n                \nSometimes, cancer from another part of the body can spread to the bone and cause aplastic anemia.\n                \nInherited Causes\n                \nCertain inherited conditions can damage the stem cells and lead to aplastic anemia. Examples include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, dyskeratosis (DIS-ker-ah-TO-sis) congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia."

            "answer": "Lower than normal numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets cause most of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Low Blood Cell Counts\n                \n\n                \nRed Blood Cells\n                \nThe most common symptom of a low red blood cell count is fatigue (tiredness). A lack of hemoglobin in the blood causes fatigue. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps carry oxygen to the body.\n                \nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath; dizziness, especially when standing up; headaches; coldness in your hands or feet; pale skin; and chest pain.\n                \nIf you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move the reduced amount of oxygen in your blood. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\n                \nWhite Blood Cells\n                \nWhite blood cells help fight infections. Signs and symptoms of a low white blood cell count include fevers, frequent infections that can be severe, and flu-like illnesses that linger.\n                \nPlatelets\n                \nPlatelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. People who have low platelet counts tend to bruise and bleed easily, and the bleeding may be hard to stop.\n                \nCommon types of bleeding associated with a low platelet count include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, pinpoint red spots on the skin, and blood in the stool. Women also may have heavy menstrual bleeding.\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms\n                \nAplastic anemia can cause signs and symptoms that aren't directly related to low blood cell counts. Examples include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and skin rashes.\n                \nParoxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria\n                \nSome people who have aplastic anemia have a condition called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mal) nocturnal hemoglobinuria (HE-mo-glo-bi-NOO-re-ah), or PNH. This is a red blood cell disorder. Most people who have PNH don't have any signs or symptoms.\n                \nIf symptoms do occur, they may include:\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nSwelling or pain in the abdomen or swelling in the legs caused by blood clots\n                \nBlood in the urine\n                \nHeadaches\n                \nJaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\n                \nIn people who have aplastic anemia and PNH, either condition can develop first."

            "question": "How to diagnose Aplastic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose aplastic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nOnce your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf your primary care doctor thinks you have aplastic anemia, he or she may refer you to a hematologist. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating blood diseases and disorders.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask questions about your medical history, such as whether:\n                \nYou've had anemia or a condition that can cause anemia\n                \nYou have shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, or other signs and symptoms of anemia\n                \nYou've been exposed to certain toxins or medicines\n                \nYou've had radiation or chemotherapy (treatments for cancer)\n                \nYou've had infections or signs of infections, such as fever\n                \nYou bruise or bleed easily\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether any of your family members have had anemia or other blood disorders.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of aplastic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the disorder is and what's causing it.\n                \nThe exam may include checking for pale or yellowish skin and signs of bleeding or infection. Your doctor may listen to your heart and lungs for abnormal heartbeats and breathing sounds. He or she also may feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and feel your legs for swelling.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nMany tests are used to diagnose aplastic anemia. These tests help:\n                \nConfirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, look for its cause, and find out how severe it is\n                \nRule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms\n                \nCheck for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose aplastic anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\n                \nThis test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\n                \nThe normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of aplastic anemia, an infection, or another condition.\n                \nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia.\n                \nReticulocyte Count\n                \nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have aplastic anemia have low reticulocyte levels.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nBone marrow aspiration may be done to find out if and why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a needle. The sample is looked at under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\n                \nA bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle.\n                \nThe tissue is checked for the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow has a lower than normal number of all three types of blood cells.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of aplastic anemia. Thus, other tests may be needed to rule out those conditions. These tests may include:\n                \nX ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or an ultrasound imaging test. These tests can show enlarged lymph nodes in your abdomen. Enlarged lymph nodes may be a sign of blood cancer. Doctors also may use these tests to look at the kidneys and the bones in the arms and hands, which are sometimes abnormal in young people who have Fanconi anemia. This type of anemia can lead to aplastic anemia.\n                \nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray may be used to rule out infections.\n                \nLiver tests and viral studies. These tests are used to check for liver diseases and viruses.\n                \nTests that check vitamin B12 and folate levels in the blood. These tests can help rule out anemia caused by vitamin deficiency.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests for PNH and to check your immune system for proteins called antibodies. (Antibodies in the immune system that attack your bone marrow cells may cause aplastic anemia.)"

These treatments can prevent or limit complications, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.\n                \nBlood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure the disorder in some people who are eligible for a transplant. Removing a known cause of aplastic anemia, such as exposure to a toxin, also may cure the condition.\n                \nWho Needs Treatment\n                \nPeople who have mild or moderate aplastic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesn't get worse. People who have severe aplastic anemia need medical treatment right away to prevent complications.\n                \nPeople who have very severe aplastic anemia need emergency medical care in a hospital. Very severe aplastic anemia can be fatal if it's not treated right away.\n                \nBlood Transfusions\n                \nBlood transfusions can help keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels.\n                \nTransfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\n                \nBlood transfusions help relieve the symptoms of aplastic anemia, but they're not a permanent treatment.\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplants\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).\n                \nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\n                \nBlood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in people who can have this type of treatment. The transplant works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are in good health and who have matched donors.\n                \nOlder people may be less able to handle the treatments needed to prepare the body for the transplant. They're also more likely to have complications after the transplant.\n                \nIf you have aplastic anemia, talk with your doctor about whether a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is an option for you.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have aplastic anemia, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nStimulate your bone marrow\n                \nSuppress your immune system\n                \nPrevent and treat infections\n                \nMedicines To Stimulate Bone Marrow\n                \nMan-made versions of substances that occur naturally in the body can stimulate the bone marrow to make more blood cells. Examples of these types of medicines include erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors.\n                \nThese medicines have some risks. You and your doctor will work together to decide whether the benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks. If this treatment works well, it can help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.\n                \nMedicines To Suppress the Immune System\n                \nResearch suggests that aplastic anemia may sometimes occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress your immune system.\n                \nThese medicines allow your bone marrow to start making blood cells again. They also may help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.\n                \nMedicines that suppress the immune system don't cure aplastic anemia. However, they can relieve its symptoms and reduce complications. These medicines often are used for people who can't have blood and marrow stem cell transplants or who are waiting for transplants.\n                \nThree medicinesoften given togethercan suppress the body's immune system. They are antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone.\n                \nIt may take a few months to notice the effects of these medicines. Most often, as blood cell counts rise, symptoms lessen. Blood cell counts in people who respond well to these medicines usually don't reach normal levels. However, the blood cell counts often are high enough to allow people to do their normal activities.\n                \nPeople who have aplastic anemia may need long-term treatment with these medicines.\n                \nMedicines that suppress the immune system can have side effects. They also may increase the risk of developing leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or myelodysplasia (MI-e-lo-dis-PLA-ze-ah; MDS). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. MDS is a condition in which the bone marrow makes too many faulty blood cells.\n                \nMedicines To Prevent and Treat Infections\n                \nIf you have aplastic anemia, you might be at risk for infections due to low white blood cell counts. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic and antiviral medicines to prevent and treat infections."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nBronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)\n                \nPeople who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath.\n                \nBronchitis\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing).\n                \nAcute Bronchitis\n                \nInfections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed).\n                \nSometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis.\n                \nAcute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone.\n                \nSeveral factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis.\n                \nMost cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care.\n                \nChronic Bronchitis\n                \nChronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.\n                \nViruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual.\n                \nChronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis."

This is because they don't work against virusesthe most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics.\n                \nA humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists).\n                \nIf you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form).\n                \nIf you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen.\n                \nOne of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking.

            "answer": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PULL-mun-ary fi-BRO-sis) is a disease in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes thick and stiff, or scarred, over time. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis.\n                \nAs the lung tissue thickens, your lungs can't properly move oxygen into your bloodstream. As a result, your brain and other organs don't get the oxygen they need. (For more information, go to the \"How the Lungs Work\" section of this article.)\n                \nSometimes doctors can find out what's causing fibrosis. But in most cases, they can't find a cause. They call these cases idiopathic (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n                \nIPF is a serious disease that usually affects middle-aged and older adults. IPF varies from person to person. In some people, fibrosis happens quickly. In others, the process is much slower. In some people, the disease stays the same for years.\n                \nIPF has no cure yet. Many people live only about 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. The most common cause of death related to IPF is respiratory failure. Other causes of death include pulmonary hypertension (HI-per-TEN-shun), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (EM-bo-lizm), pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah), and lung cancer.\n                \nGenetics may play a role in causing IPF. If more than one member of your family has IPF, the disease is called familial IPF.\n                \nResearch has helped doctors learn more about IPF. As a result, they can more quickly diagnose the disease now than in the past. Also, researchers are studying several medicines that may slow the progress of IPF. These efforts may improve the lifespan and quality of life for people who have the disease."

            "question": "What causes Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ?",
            "answer": "Sometimes doctors can find out what is causing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring). For example, exposure to environmental pollutants and certain medicines can cause the disease.\n                \nEnvironmental pollutants include inorganic dust (silica and hard metal dusts) and organic dust (bacteria and animal proteins).\n                \nMedicines that are known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in some people include nitrofurantoin (an antibiotic), amiodarone (a heart medicine), methotrexate and bleomycin (both chemotherapy medicines), and many other medicines.\n                \nIn most cases, however, the cause of lung scarring isnt known. These cases are called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). With IPF, doctors think that something inside or outside of the lungs attacks them again and again over time.\n                \nThese attacks injure the lungs and scar the tissue inside and between the air sacs. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sac walls into the bloodstream.\n                \nThe following factors may increase your risk of IPF:\n                \nCigarette smoking\n                \nViral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis), influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and herpes virus 6\n                \nGenetics also may play a role in causing IPF. Some families have at least two members who have IPF.\n                \nResearchers have found that 9 out of 10 people who have IPF also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition in which acid from your stomach backs up into your throat.\n                \nSome people who have GERD may regularly breathe in tiny drops of acid from their stomachs.

This makes it hard to diagnose.\n                \nSeeking medical help as soon as you have symptoms is important. If possible, seek care from a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung problems.\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose IPF based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Tests can help rule out other causes of your symptoms and show how badly your lungs are damaged.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask about:\n                \nYour age\n                \nYour history of smoking\n                \nThings in the air at your job or elsewhere that could irritate your lungs\n                \nYour hobbies\n                \nYour history of legal and illegal drug use\n                \nOther medical conditions that you have\n                \nYour family's medical history\n                \nHow long you've had symptoms\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nNo single test can diagnose IPF. Your doctor may recommend several of the following tests.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates a picture of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show shadows that suggest scar tissue. However, many people who have IPF have normal chest x rays at the time they're diagnosed.\n                \nHigh-Resolution Computed Tomography\n                \nA high-resolution computed tomography scan, or HRCT scan, is an x ray that provides sharper and more detailed pictures than a standard chest x ray.\n                \nHRCT can show scar tissue and how much lung damage you have. This test can help your doctor spot IPF at an early stage or rule it out. HRCT also can help your doctor decide how likely you are to respond to treatment.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nYour doctor may suggest a breathing test called spirometry(spi-ROM-eh-tree) to find out how much lung damage you have. This test measures how much air you can blow out of your lungs after taking a deep breath. Spirometry also measures how fast you can breathe the air out.\n                \nIf you have a lot of lung scarring, you won't be able to breathe out a normal amount of air.\n                \nPulse Oximetry\n                \nFor this test, your doctor attaches a small sensor to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\n                \nArterial Blood Gas Test\n                \nFor this test, your doctor takes a blood sample from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured.\n                \nThis test is more accurate than pulse oximetry. The blood sample also can be tested to see whether an infection is causing your symptoms.\n                \nSkin Test for Tuberculosis\n                \nFor this test, your doctor injects a substance under the top layer of skin on one of your arms. This substance reacts to tuberculosis (TB). If you have a positive reaction, a small hard lump will develop at the injection site 48 to 72 hours after the test. This test is done to rule out TB.\n                \nExercise Testing\n                \nExercise testing shows how well your lungs move oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of your bloodstream when you're active. During this test, you walk or pedal on an exercise machine for a few minutes.\n                \nAn EKG(electrocardiogram) checks your heart rate, a blood pressure cuff checks your blood pressure, and a pulse oximeter shows how much oxygen is in your blood.\n                \nYour doctor may place a catheter (a flexible tube) in an artery in one of your arms to draw blood samples. These samples will provide a more precise measure of the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask you to breathe into a tube that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.\n                \nLung Biopsy\n                \nFor a lung biopsy, your doctor will take samples of lung tissue from several places in your lungs. The samples are examined under a microscope. A lung biopsy is the best way for your doctor to diagnose IPF.\n                \nThis procedure can help your doctor rule out other conditions, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis), cancer, or infection. Lung biopsy also can show your doctor how far your disease has advanced.\n                \nDoctors use several procedures to get lung tissue samples.\n                \nVideo-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). This is the most common procedure used to get lung tissue samples. Your doctor inserts a small tube with an attached light and camera into your chest through small cuts between your ribs. The tube is called an endoscope.\n                \nThe endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows your doctor to collect tissue samples. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure.\n                \nBronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). For a bronchoscopy, your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into your airways. At the tube's tip are a light and mini-camera. They allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways.\n                \nYour doctor then inserts a forceps through the tube to collect tissue samples. You'll be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure.\n                \nBronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). During bronchoscopy, your doctor may inject a small amount of salt water (saline) through the tube into your lungs. This fluid washes the lungs and helps bring up cells from the area around the air sacs. These cells are examined under a microscope.\n                \nThoracotomy (thor-ah-KOT-o-me). For this procedure, your doctor removes a few small pieces of lung tissue through a cut in the chest wall between your ribs. Thoracotomy is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure."

You usually take it by mouth every day. Because it can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it with prednisone for only 3 to 6 months.\n                \nIf you don't have serious side effects and the medicines seem to help you, your doctor may keep you on them longer.\n                \nN-acetylcysteine\n                \nN-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that may help prevent lung damage. You usually take it by mouth several times a day.\n                \nA common treatment for IPF is a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine. However, this treatment was recently found harmful in a study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n                \nIf you have IPF and take this combination of medicines, talk with your doctor. Do not stop taking the medicines on your own.\n                \nThe NHLBI currently supports research to compare N-acetylcysteine treatment with placebo treatment (sugar pills) in patients who have IPF.\n                \nNew Medicines Being Studied\n                \nResearchers, like those in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network, are studying new treatments for IPF. With the support and guidance of the NHLBI, these researchers continue to look for new IPF treatments and therapies.\n                \nSome of these researchers are studying medicines that may reduce inflammation and prevent or reduce scarring caused by IPF.\n                \nIf you're interested in joining a research study, talk with your doctor. For more information about ongoing research, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments that may help people who have IPF include the following:\n                \nFlu andpneumonia vaccines may help prevent infections and keep you healthy.\n                \nCough medicines or oral codeine may relieve coughing.\n                \nVitamin D, calcium, and a bone-building medicine may help prevent bone loss if you're taking prednisone or another corticosteroid.\n                \nAnti-reflux therapy may help control gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Most people who have IPF also have GERD.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nIf the amount of oxygen in your blood gets low, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy can help reduce shortness of breath and allow you to be more active.\n                \nOxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. At first, you may need it only during exercise and sleep. As your disease worsens, you may need it all the time.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\n                \nPulmonary Rehabilitation\n                \nPR is now a standard treatment for people who have chronic (ongoing) lung disease. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have breathing problems.\n                \nThe program usually involves treatment by a team of specialists in a special clinic. The goal is to teach you how to manage your condition and function at your best.\n                \nPR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:\n                \nExercise training\n                \nNutritional counseling\n                \nEducation on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it\n                \nEnergy-conserving techniques\n                \nBreathing strategies\n                \nPsychological counseling and/or group support\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.\n                \nLung Transplant\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a lung transplant if your condition is quickly worsening or very severe. A lung transplant can improve your quality of life and help you live longer.\n                \nSome medical centers will consider patients older than 65 for lung transplants if they have no other serious medical problems.\n                \nThe major complications of a lung transplant are rejection and infection. (\"Rejection\" refers to your body creating proteins that attack the new organ.) You will have to take medicines for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of rejection.\n                \nBecause the supply of donor lungs is limited, talk with your doctor about a lung transplant as soon as possible.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Lung Transplant article."

            "question": "What is (are) Peripheral Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the body's arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.\n                \nP.A.D. usually affects the arteries in the legs, but it also can affect the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your head, arms, kidneys, and stomach. This article focuses on P.A.D. that affects blood flow to the legs.\n                \nNormal Artery and Artery With Plaque Buildup\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nBlocked blood flow to your legs can cause pain and numbness. It also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limbs. Your body may have a hard time fighting the infection.\n                \nIf severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death). In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation.\n                \nIf you have leg pain when you walk or climb stairs, talk with your doctor. Sometimes older people think that leg pain is just a symptom of aging. However, the cause of the pain could be P.A.D. Tell your doctor if you're feeling pain in your legs and discuss whether you should be tested for P.A.D.\n                \nSmoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. If you smoke or have a history of smoking, your risk of P.A.D. increases. Other factors, such as age and having certain diseases or conditions, also increase your risk of P.A.D.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nP.A.D. increases your risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack(\"mini-stroke\").Although P.A.D. is serious, it's treatable. If you have the disease, see your doctor regularly and treat the underlying atherosclerosis.P.A.D. treatment may slow or stop disease progress and reduce the risk of complications. Treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery or procedures. Researchers continue to explore new therapies for P.A.D."

The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known.\n                \nThe disease may start if certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nWhen damage occurs, your body starts a healing process. The healing may cause plaque to build up where the arteries are damaged.\n                \nEventually, a section of plaque can rupture (break open), causing a blood clot to form at the site. The buildup of plaque or blood clots can severely narrow or block the arteries and limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body."

The disease is more common in blacks than any other racial or ethnic group.The major risk factors for P.A.D. are smoking, older age, and having certain diseases or conditions.\n                \nSmoking\n                \nSmoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. and your risk increases if you smoke or have a history of smoking. Quitting smoking slows the progress of P.A.D. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications, such as gangrene (tissue death) in the leg from decreased blood flow.\n                \nOlder Age\n                \nOlder age also is a risk factor for P.A.D.

Symptoms may ease after resting.These symptoms are called intermittent claudication.\n                \nDuring physical activity, your muscles need increased blood flow. If your blood vessels are narrowed or blocked, your muscles won't get enough blood, which will lead to symptoms.

            "question": "How to diagnose Peripheral Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nP.A.D. often is diagnosed after symptoms are reported. A correct diagnosis is important because people who have P.A.D. are at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (\"mini-stroke\"). If you have P.A.D., your doctor also may want to check for signs of these diseases and conditions.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctors, such as internists and family doctors, may treat people who have mild P.A.D. For more advanced P.A.D., a vascular specialist may be involved. This is a doctor who specializes in treating blood vessel diseases and conditions.\n                \nA cardiologist also may be involved in treating people who have P.A.D. Cardiologists treat heart problems, such as CHD and heart attack, which often affect people who have P.A.D.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask:\n                \nWhether you have any risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes.\n                \nAbout your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing.\n                \nAbout your diet.\n                \nAbout any medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n                \nWhether anyone in your family has a history of heart or blood vessel diseases.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses.\n                \nYour doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit. He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery.\n                \nYour doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she also may check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that may be signs of P.A.D.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nAnkle-Brachial Index\n                \nA simple test called an ankle-brachial index (ABI) often is used to diagnose P.A.D. The ABI compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm. This test shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs.\n                \nABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it won't show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked.\n                \nA normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse.\n                \nAnkle-Brachial Index\n                \n\n                \nDoppler Ultrasound\n                \nA Doppler ultrasound looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs. During this test, a handheld device is placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. A computer converts sound waves into a picture of blood flow in the arteries and veins.\n                \nThe results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D.\n                \nTreadmill Test\n                \nA treadmill test can show the severity of symptoms and the level of exercise that brings them on. You'll walk on a treadmill for this test. This shows whether you have any problems during normal walking.\n                \nYou may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Angiogram\n                \nA magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) uses magnetic and radio wave energy to take pictures of your blood vessels. This test is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n                \nAn MRA can show the location and severity of a blocked blood vessel. If you have a pacemaker, man-made joint, stent, surgical clips, mechanical heart valve, or other metallic devices in your body, you might not be able to have an MRA. Ask your doctor whether an MRA is an option for you.\n                \nArteriogram\n                \nAn arteriogram provides a \"road map\" of the arteries. Doctors use this test to find the exact location of a blocked artery.\n                \nFor this test, dye is injected through a needle or catheter (tube) into one of your arteries. This may make you feel mildly flushed. After the dye is injected, an x ray is taken. The xray can show the location, type, and extent of the blockage in the artery.\n                \nSome doctors use a newer method of arteriogram that uses tiny ultrasound cameras. These cameras take pictures of the insides of the blood vessels. This method is called intravascular ultrasound.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend blood tests to check for P.A.D. risk factors. For example, blood tests can help diagnose conditions such as diabetes and high blood cholesterol."

Treatment is based on your signs and symptoms, risk factors, and the results of physical exams and tests.\n                \n\n                \nTreatment may slow or stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, P.A.D. may progress, resulting in serious tissue damage in the form of sores or gangrene (tissue death) due to inadequate blood flow. In extreme cases of P.A.D., also referred to as critical limb ischemia (CLI), removal (amputation) of part of the leg or foot may be necessary.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nTreatment often includes making long-lasting lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can improve P.A.D. symptoms and lower many risk factors for atherosclerosis, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Exercise can improve the distances you can comfortably walk.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about taking part in a supervised exercise program. If a supervised program is not an option, ask your doctor to help you develop an exercise plan. Most exercise programs begin slowly, which includes simple walking alternating with rest. Over time, most people build up the amount of time they can walk before developing pain. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking raises your risk for P.A.D. Smoking also raises your risk for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease and heart attack, and worsens other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \n\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating to treat atherosclerosis, the most common cause of P.A.D. Following heart-healthy eating can help control blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming due to low blood flow with anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin.\n                \nTreat unhealthy cholesterol levels with statins. Statins control or lower blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of developing complications from P.A.D.\n                \nTreat high blood pressure with one of many high blood pressure medicines.\n                \nHelp ease leg pain that occurs when you walk or climb stairs.\n                \nReduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication, measured by increased walking distance with certain platelet-aggregation inhibitors.\n                \n\n                \nSurgery or Procedures\n                \nBypass Grafting\n                \nYour doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. For this surgery, your doctor uses a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic tube to make a graft.\n                \nThis graft bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the artery. The bypass allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesnt cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.\n                \n\n                \nAngioplasty and Stent Placement\n                \nYour doctor may recommend angioplasty to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blockedartery.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at the tip is inserted into a blocked artery. The balloon is then inflated, which pushes plaque outward against the artery wall. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.\n                \n\n                \nA stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. A stent helps keep the artery open after angioplasty is done. Some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery.\n                \n\n                \nAtherectomy\n                \nAtherectomy is a procedure that removes plaque buildup from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. The device is used to shave or cut off plaque.\n                \nThe bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough).\n                \n\n                \nDoctors also can perform atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage.\n                \n\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nResearchers are studying cell and gene therapies to treat P.A.D.

            "question": "What is (are) Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease ?",
            "answer": "Childhood interstitial (in-ter-STISH-al) lung disease, or chILD, is a broad term for a group of rare lung diseases that can affect babies, children, and teens. These diseases have some similar symptoms, such as chronic cough, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath.\n                \nThese diseases also harm the lungs in similar ways. For example, they damage the tissues that surround the lungs' alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye; air sacs) and bronchial tubes (airways). Sometimes these diseases directly damage the air sacs and airways.\n                \nThe various types of chILD can decrease lung function, reduce blood oxygen levels, and disturb the breathing process.\n                \nOverview\n                \nResearchers have only begun to study, define, and understand chILD in the last decade. Currently, they don't know how many children have chILD. They also don't know how many children have each type of chILD.\n                \nDiagnosing chILD and its specific diseases is hard because chILD is rare and complex. Also, chILD is a broad term for a group of diseases with similar symptomsit's not a precise diagnosis.\n                \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) also occurs in adults. However, the cause of ILD in adults may be different than the cause in children. Some types of chILD are similar to the adult forms of the disease. They may even have the same names as the adult forms, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-NI-tis), immunodeficiency-associated lung disease, and bronchiolitis (brong-ke-o-LI-tis) obliterans.\n                \nHowever, research shows that the course and outcomes of these diseases often are very different for children than for adults.\n                \nSome ILDs only occur in children. They include:\n                \nLung growth abnormalities\n                \nNeuroendocrine (noor-o-EN-do-krin) cell hyperplasia (hi-per-PLA-ze-ah) of infancy (NEHI)\n                \nPulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (gli-ko-JEN-eh-sis)\n                \nDevelopmental disorders, such as alveolar (al-VE-o-lar) capillary dysplasia\n                \nOutlook\n                \nEach form of chILD may differ in its severity and how it's treated. Thus, getting a correct diagnosis is vital for understanding and treating your child's illness.\n                \nYou may want to consult a pediatric pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions. This doctor's training and experience can help him or her diagnose chILD.\n                \nThe outlook for children who have chILD also depends on the specific type of disease they have. Some diseases are very severe and lead to early death. Others are chronic (long-term) diseases that parents and the child's medical team must work together to manage.\n                \nAt this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as NEHI, may slowly improve over time.\n                \nResearchers are now starting to learn more about the causes of chILD. They're also trying to find distinct patterns and traits for the various forms of chILD. This information may help doctors better understand these diseases."

            "answer": "Researchers don't yet know all of the causes of childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Many times, these diseases have no clear cause.\n                \nSome conditions and factors that may cause or lead to chILD include:\n                \nInherited conditions, such as surfactant disorders. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps with breathing and may help protect the lungs from bacterial and viral infections.\n                \nBirth defects that cause problems with the structure or function of the lungs.\n                \nAspiration (as-pih-RA-shun). This term refers to inhaling substancessuch as food, liquid, or vomitinto the lungs. Inhaling these substances can injure the lungs. Aspiration may occur in children who have swallowing problems or gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs if acid from the stomach backs up into the throat.\n                \nImmune system disorders. The immune system protects the body against bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Children who have immune system disorders aren't able to fight illness and disease as well as children who have healthy immune systems.\n                \nExposure to substances in the environment that can irritate the lungs, such as molds and chemicals.\n                \nSome cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy.\n                \nSystemic or autoimmune diseases, such as collagen vascular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the body's organs. Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's tissues and cells.\n                \nA bone marrow transplant or a lung transplant."

            "question": "How to diagnose Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease ?",
            "answer": "Doctors diagnose childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) based on a child's medical and family histories and the results from tests and procedures. To diagnose chILD, doctors may first need to rule out other diseases as the cause of a child's symptoms.\n                \nEarly diagnosis of chILD may help doctors stop or even reverse lung function problems. Often though, doctors find chILD hard to diagnose because:\n                \nThere are many types of the disease and a range of underlying causes\n                \nThe disease's signs and symptoms are the same as those for many other diseases\n                \nThe disease may coexist with other diseases\n                \nGoing to a pediatric pulmonologist who has experience with chILD is helpful. A pediatric pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour child's medical history can help his or her doctor diagnose chILD. The doctor may ask whether your child:\n                \nHas severe breathing problems that occur often.\n                \nHas had severe lung infections.\n                \nHad serious lung problems as a newborn.\n                \nHas been exposed to possible lung irritants in the environment, such as birds, molds, dusts, or chemicals.\n                \nHas ever had radiation or chemotherapy treatment.\n                \nHas an autoimmune disease, certain birth defects, or other medical conditions. (Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the bodys tissues and cells.)\n                \nThe doctor also may ask how old your child was when symptoms began, and whether other family members have or have had severe lung diseases. If they have, your child may have an inherited form of chILD.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nNo single test can diagnose the many types of chILD. Thus, your child's doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests. For some of these tests, infants and young children may be given medicine to help them relax or sleep.\n                \nA chest x ray. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your child's chest, such as the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can help rule out other lung diseases as the cause of your child's symptoms.\n                \nA high-resolution CT scan (HRCT). An HRCT scan uses x rays to create detailed pictures of your child's lungs. This test can show the location, extent, and severity of lung disease.\n                \nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air your child can breathe in and out, how fast he or she can breathe air out, and how well your child's lungs deliver oxygen to the blood. Lung function tests can assess the severity of lung disease. Infants and young children may need to have these tests at a center that has special equipment for children.\n                \nBronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). For this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through a tube inserted in the child's lungs. The fluid helps bring up cells from the tissues around the air sacs. The doctor can then look at these cells under a microscope. This procedure can help detect an infection, lung injury, bleeding, aspiration, or an airway problem.\n                \nVarious tests to rule out conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, acid reflux, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and immune deficiency.\n                \nVarious tests for systemic diseases linked to chILD. Systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the body's organs.\n                \nBlood tests to check for inherited (genetic) diseases and disorders.\n                \nIf these tests don't provide enough information, your child's doctor may recommend a lung biopsy. A lung biopsy is the most reliable way to diagnose chILD and the specific disease involved.\n                \nA lung biopsy is a surgical procedure that's done in a hospital. Before the biopsy, your child will receive medicine to make him or her sleep.\n                \nDuring the biopsy, the doctor will take small samples of lung tissue from several places in your child's lungs. This often is done using video-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pe).\n                \nFor this procedure, the doctor inserts a small tube with a light and camera (endoscope) into your child's chest through small cuts between the ribs. The endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows the doctor to collect tissue samples.\n                \nAfter the biopsy, the doctor will look at these samples under a microscope."

            "answer": "Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is rare, and little research has been done on how to treat it. At this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, may slowly improve over time.\n                \nCurrent treatment approaches include supportive therapy, medicines, and, in the most serious cases, lung transplants.\n                \nSupportive Therapy\n                \nSupportive therapy refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to relieve common chILD symptoms include:\n                \nOxygen therapy. If your child's blood oxygen level is low, he or she may need oxygen therapy. This treatment can improve breathing, support growth, and reduce strain on the heart.\n                \nBronchodilators. These medications relax the muscles around your childs airways, which helps open the airways and makes breathing easier.\n                \nBreathing devices. Children who have severe disease may need ventilators or other devices to help them breathe easier.\n                \nExtra nutrition. This treatment can help improve your child's growth and help him or her gain weight. Close monitoring of growth is especially important.\n                \nTechniques and devices to help relieve lung congestion. These may include chest physical therapy (CPT) or wearing a vest that helps move mucus (a sticky substance) to the upper airways so it can be coughed up. CPT may involve pounding the chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen mucus in the lungs so that your child can cough it up.\n                \nSupervised pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nCorticosteroids are a common treatment for many children who have chILD. These medicines help reduce lung inflammation.\n                \nOther medicines can help treat specific types or causes of chILD. For example, antimicrobial medicines can treat a lung infection. Acid-blocking medicines can prevent acid reflux, which can lead to aspiration.\n                \nLung Transplant\n                \nA lung transplant may be an option for children who have severe chILD if other treatments haven't worked.\n                \nCurrently, lung transplants are the only effective treatment for some types of chILD that have a high risk of death, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia and certain surfactant dysfunction mutations.\n                \nEarly diagnosis of these diseases gives children the chance to receive lung transplants. So far, chILD doesn't appear to come back in patients' transplanted lungs.\n                \nFor more information about this treatment, go to the Health Topics Lung Transplant article."

A counselor can explain the risk of children inheriting chILD.\n                \nYou and your child can take steps to help prevent infections and other illnesses that worsen chILD and its symptoms. For example:\n                \nMake hand washing a family habit to avoid germs and prevent illnesses.\n                \nTry to keep your child away from people who are sick. Even a common cold can cause problems for someone who has chILD.\n                \nTalk with your child's doctor about vaccines that your child needs, such as an annual flu shot. Make sure everyone in your household gets all of the vaccines that their doctors recommend.\n                \nTalk with your child's doctor about how to prevent your child from getting respiratory syncytial (sin-SIT-e-al) virus. This common virus leads to cold and flu symptoms for most people. However, it can make children who have lung diseases very sick.\n                \nAvoid exposing your child to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and other substances that can irritate his or her lungs.

As a result, they may get too little sleep or have poor-quality sleep. They may not feel refreshed when they wake up.\n                \nOverview\n                \nInsomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). Acute insomnia is common and often is brought on by situations such as stress at work, family pressures, or a traumatic event. Acute insomnia lasts for days or weeks.\n                \nChronic insomnia lasts for a month or longer. Most cases of chronic insomnia are secondary, which means they are the symptom or side effect of some other problem. Certain medical conditions, medicines, sleep disorders, and substances can cause secondary insomnia.\n                \nIn contrast, primary insomnia isn't due to medical problems, medicines, or other substances. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isnt well understood. Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia, including long-lasting stress and emotional upset.\n                \nInsomnia can cause daytime sleepiness and a lack of energy. It also can make you feel anxious, depressed, or irritable. You may have trouble focusing on tasks, paying attention, learning, and remembering. These problems can prevent you from doing your best at work or school.\n                \nInsomnia also can cause other serious problems.

Also, he or she may ask whether you have other family members who have sleep problems.\n                \nSleep History\n                \nTo get a better sense of your sleep problem, your doctor will ask you for details about your sleep habits. Before your visit, think about how to describe your problems, including:\n                \nHow often you have trouble sleeping and how long you've had the problem\n                \nWhen you go to bed and get up on workdays and days off\n                \nHow long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake up at night, and how long it takes to fall back asleep\n                \nWhether you snore loudly and often or wake up gasping or feeling out of breath\n                \nHow refreshed you feel when you wake up, and how tired you feel during the day\n                \nHow often you doze off or have trouble staying awake during routine tasks, especially driving\n                \nTo find out what's causing or worsening your insomnia, your doctor also may ask you:\n                \nWhether you worry about falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting enough sleep\n                \nWhat you eat or drink, and whether you take medicines before going to bed\n                \nWhat routine you follow before going to bed\n                \nWhat the noise level, lighting, and temperature are like where you sleep\n                \nWhat distractions, such as a TV or computer, are in your bedroom\n                \nTo help your doctor, consider keeping a sleep diary for 1 or 2 weeks. Write down when you go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. (For example, you might note: Went to bed at 10 a.m.; woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't fall back asleep; napped after work for 2 hours.)\n                \nAlso write down how much you sleep each night, as well as how sleepy you feel throughout the day.\n                \nYou can find a sample sleep diary in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems that might cause insomnia. You also may need blood tests to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that can cause sleep problems.\n                \nSleep Study\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a sleep study called a polysomnogram (PSG) if he or she thinks an underlying sleep disorder is causing your insomnia.\n                \nYoull likely stay overnight at a sleep center for this study. The PSG records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n                \nA PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you're making an effort to breathe."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Insomnia ?",
            "answer": "Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n                \nA type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.\n                \nSeveral medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nIf you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:\n                \nCaffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.\n                \nCertain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.\n                \nAlcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.\n                \nTry to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.\n                \nTry to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.\n                \nMake your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.\n                \nGo to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.\n                \nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy\n                \nCBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.\n                \nFor example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.\n                \nCBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.\n                \nCBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.\n                \nCBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.\n                \nThis schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.\n                \nFor success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.\n                \nFor people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nPrescription Medicines\n                \nMany prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.\n                \nTalk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.\n                \nRare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.\n                \nSome insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.\n                \nOver-the-Counter Products\n                \nSome over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.\n                \nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate natural products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.\n                \nSome OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.\n                \nAntihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you."

            "question": "What is (are) Rh Incompatibility ?",
            "answer": "Rh incompatibility is a condition that occurs during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood.\n                \n\"Rh-negative\" and \"Rh-positive\" refer to whether your blood has Rh factor. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. If you have Rh factor, you're Rh-positive. If you don't have it, you're Rh-negative. Rh factor is inherited (passed from parents to children through the genes). Most people are Rh-positive.\n                \nWhether you have Rh factor doesn't affect your general health. However, it can cause problems during pregnancy.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWhen you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.\n                \nYour body will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's Rh-positive blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy. This is because the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop.\n                \nHowever, the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. Thus, Rh incompatibility is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is Rh-positive).\n                \nThe Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. This can lead to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh) in the baby.\n                \nHemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body.\n                \nWithout enough red blood cells, your baby won't get enough oxygen. This can lead to serious problems. Severe hemolytic anemia may even be fatal to the child.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nWith prompt and proper prenatal care and screening, you can prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. Screening tests allow your doctor to find out early in your pregnancy whether you're at risk for the condition.\n                \nIf you're at risk, your doctor will carefully check on you and your baby throughout your pregnancy and prescribe treatment as needed.\n                \nInjections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rhantibodies. This medicine helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. If you're Rh-negative, you'll need this medicine every time you have a baby with Rh-positive blood.\n                \nOther events also can expose you to Rh-positive blood, which could affect a pregnancy. Examples include a miscarriage or blood transfusion. If you're treated with Rh immune globulin right after these events, you may be able to avoid Rh incompatibility during your next pregnancy."

If you're Rh-negative and the father of your baby is Rh-positive, the baby has a 50 percent or more chance of having Rh-positive blood.\n                \nSimple blood tests can show whether you and the father of your baby are Rh-positive or Rh-negative.\n                \nIf you're Rh-negative, your risk of problems from Rh incompatibility is higher if you were exposed to Rh-positive blood before the pregnancy.

When red blood cells die, they release hemoglobin into the blood. The hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. This compound gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color. High levels of bilirubin can lead to brain damage in the baby.\n                \nThe buildup of fluid is a result of heart failure.

This is a doctor who specializes in treating pregnant women. The obstetrician also will monitor the pregnancy and the baby for problems related to hemolytic anemia. He or she also will oversee treatment to prevent problems with future pregnancies.\n                \nA pediatrician or hematologist treats newborns who have hemolytic anemia and related problems. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating people who have blood diseases and disorders.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nIf you're pregnant, your doctor will order a simple blood test at your first prenatal visit to learn whether you're Rh-positive or Rh-negative.\n                \nIf you're Rh-negative, you also may have another blood test called an antibody screen. This test shows whether you have Rh antibodies in your blood. If you do, it means that you were exposed to Rh-positive blood before and you're at risk for Rh incompatibility.\n                \nIf you're Rh-negative and you don't have Rh antibodies, your baby's father also will be tested to find out his Rh type. If he's Rh-negative too, the baby has no chance of having Rh-positive blood. Thus, there's no risk of Rh incompatibility.\n                \nHowever, if the baby's father is Rh-positive, the baby has a 50 percent or more chance of having Rh-positive blood. As a result, you're at high risk of developing Rhincompatibility.\n                \nIf your baby's father is Rh-positive, or if it's not possible to find out his Rh status, your doctor may do a test called amniocentesis.\n                \nFor this test, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to learn whether the baby is Rh-positive. (Rarely, an amniocentesis can expose you to Rh-positive blood).\n                \nYour doctor also may use this test to measure bilirubin levels in your baby. Bilirubin builds up as a result of red blood cells dying too quickly. The higher the level of bilirubin is, the greater the chance that the baby has hemolytic anemia.\n                \nIf Rh incompatibility is known or suspected, you'll be tested for Rh antibodies one or more times during your pregnancy. This test often is done at least once at your sixth or seventh month of pregnancy.\n                \nThe results from this test also can suggest how severe the baby's hemolytic anemia has become. Higher levels of antibodies suggest more severe hemolytic anemia.\n                \nTo check your baby for hemolytic anemia, your doctor also may use a test called Doppler ultrasound. He or she will use this test to measure how fast blood is flowing through an artery in the baby's head.\n                \nDoppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure how fast blood is moving. The faster the blood flow is, the greater the risk of hemolytic anemia. This is because the anemia will cause the baby's heart to pump more blood."

When this happens, your body doesn't react to the baby's Rh-positive cells as a foreign substance. As a result, your body doesn't make Rh antibodies. Rh immune globulin must be given at the correct times to work properly.\n                \nOnce you have formed Rh antibodies, the medicine will no longer help. That's why a woman who has Rh-negative blood must be treated with the medicine with each pregnancy or any other event that allows her blood to mix with Rh-positive blood.\n                \nRh immune globulin is injected into the muscle of your arm or buttock. Side effects may include soreness at the injection site and a slight fever.

These treatments can prompt the body to make red blood cells.\n                \nIf the hemolytic anemia is severe, the baby may get a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord. If the hemolytic anemia is severe and the baby is almost full-term, your doctor may induce labor early. This allows the baby's doctor to begin treatment right away.\n                \nA newborn who has severe anemia may be treated with a blood exchange transfusion. The procedure involves slowly removing the newborn's blood and replacing it with fresh blood or plasma from a donor.\n                \nNewborns also may be treated with special lights to reduce the amount of bilirubin in their blood. These babies may have jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes). High levels of bilirubin cause jaundice.\n                \nReducing the blood's bilirubin level is important because high levels of this compound can cause brain damage. High levels of bilirubin often are seen in babies who have hemolytic anemia. This is because the compound forms when red blood cells break down."

Examples include different kinds of bacteria, viruses, and, less often, fungi.\n                \nMost of the time, the body filters germs out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia (SIL-e-ah) help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. (For more information, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)\n                \nSometimes, though, germs manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if:\n                \nYour immune system is weak\n                \nA germ is very strong\n                \nYour body fails to filter germs out of the air that you breathe\n                \nFor example, if you can't cough because you've had a stroke or are sedated, germs may remain in your airways. (\"Sedated\" means you're given medicine to make you sleepy.)\n                \nWhen germs reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli (air sacs) to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia.\n                \nGerms That Can Cause Pneumonia\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people, especially the elderly and those who are disabled, may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold.\n                \nMany types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia.\n                \nThe most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus (strep-to-KOK-us) pneumoniae, or pneumococcus (nu-mo-KOK-us).\n                \nLobar Pneumonia\n                \n\n                \nAnother type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes:\n                \nLegionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains.\n                \nMycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, mycoplasma pneumonia can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells).\n                \nChlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old.\n                \nViruses\n                \nRespiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old.\n                \nMost cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital.\n                \nIf you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well.\n                \nThe flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and more.\n                \nFungi\n                \nThree types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are:\n                \nCoccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis). This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest.\n                \nHistoplasmosis (HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis). This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.\n                \nCryptococcus (krip-to-KOK-us). This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.\n                \nMost people exposed to these fungi don't get sick, but some do and require treatment.\n                \nSerious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIV/AIDS.\n                \nPneumocystis jiroveci (nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e), formerly Pneumocystis carinii, sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However, it's not treated with the usual antifungal medicines. This type of infection is most common in people who:\n                \nHave HIV/AIDS or cancer\n                \nHave had an organ transplant and/or blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nTake medicines that affect their immune systems\n                \nOther kinds of fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Pneumonia? ?",
            "answer": "Pneumonia can affect people of all ages. However, two age groups are at greater risk of developing pneumonia:\n                \nInfants who are 2 years old or younger (because their immune systems are still developing during the first few years of life)\n                \nPeople who are 65 years old or older\n                \nOther conditions and factors also raise your risk for pneumonia. You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have a lung disease or other serious disease. Examples include cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), bronchiectasis, diabetes, heart failure, and sickle cell anemia.\n                \nYou're at greater risk for pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive-care unit, especially if you're on a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe).\n                \nHaving a weak or suppressed immune system also raises your risk for pneumonia. A weak immune system may be the result of a disease such as HIV/AIDS. A suppressed immune system may be due to an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), or long-term steroid use.\n                \nYour risk for pneumonia also increases if you have trouble coughing because of a stroke or problems swallowing. You're also at higher risk if you can't move around much or are sedated (given medicine to make you relaxed or sleepy).\n                \nSmoking cigarettes, abusing alcohol, or being undernourished also raises your risk for pneumonia. Your risk also goes up if you've recently had a cold or the flu, or if you're exposed to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, including the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Pneumonia?\")\n                \nSee your doctor promptly if you:\n                \nHave a high fever\n                \nHave shaking chills\n                \nHave a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), which doesn't improve or worsens\n                \nDevelop shortness of breath with normal daily activities\n                \nHave chest pain when you breathe or cough\n                \nFeel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu\n                \nPeople who have pneumonia may have other symptoms, including nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, and diarrhea.\n                \nSymptoms may vary in certain populations. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Or, they may vomit, have a fever and cough, or appear restless, sick, or tired and without energy.\n                \nOlder adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. If they already have a lung disease, it may get worse. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.\n                \nComplications of Pneumonia\n                \nOften, people who have pneumonia can be successfully treated and not have complications. But some people, especially those in high-risk groups, may have complications such as:\n                \nBacteremia (bak-ter-E-me-ah). This serious complication occurs if the infection moves into your bloodstream. From there, it can quickly spread to other organs, including your brain.\n                \nLung abscesses. An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. An abscess usually is treated with antibiotics. Sometimes surgery or drainage with a needle is needed to remove the pus.\n                \nPleural effusion. Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the pleural space. This is a very thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and the chest cavity. Pneumonia can cause the fluid to become infecteda condition called empyema (em-pi-E-ma). If this happens, you may need to have the fluid drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery."

            "question": "How to diagnose Pneumonia ?",
            "answer": "Pneumonia can be hard to diagnose because it may seem like a cold or the flu. You may not realize it's more serious until it lasts longer than these other conditions.\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose pneumonia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. To find out what type of germ is causing the pneumonia, he or she also may ask about:\n                \nAny recent traveling you've done\n                \nYour hobbies\n                \nYour exposure to animals\n                \nYour exposure to sick people at home, school, or work\n                \nYour past and current medical conditions, and whether any have gotten worse recently\n                \nAny medicines you take\n                \nWhether you smoke\n                \nWhether you've had flu or pneumonia vaccinations\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. If you have pneumonia, your lungs may make crackling, bubbling, and rumbling sounds when you inhale. Your doctor also may hear wheezing.\n                \nYour doctor may find it hard to hear sounds of breathing in some areas of your chest.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have pneumonia, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray is the best test for diagnosing pneumonia. However, this test won't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests involve taking a sample of blood from a vein in your body. A complete blood count (CBC) measures many parts of your blood, including the number of white blood cells in the blood sample. The number of white blood cells can show whether you have a bacterial infection.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a blood culture to find out whether the infection has spread to your bloodstream. This test is used to detect germs in the bloodstream. A blood culture may show which germ caused the infection. If so, your doctor can decide how to treat the infection.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other tests if you're in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems.\n                \nSputum test. Your doctor may look at a sample of sputum (spit) collected from you after a deep cough. This may help your doctor find out what germ is causing your pneumonia. Then, he or she can plan treatment.\n                \nChest computed tomography (CT) scan. A chest CT scan is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your lungs. A chest CT scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than those of a standard chest xray.\n                \nPleural fluid culture. For this test, a fluid sample is taken from the pleural space (a thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity). Doctors use a procedure called thoracentesis (THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis) to collect the fluid sample. The fluid is studied for germs that may cause pneumonia.\n                \nPulse oximetry. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Pneumonia can keep your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n                \nIf you're very sick, your doctor may need to measure the level of oxygen in your blood using a blood sample. The sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. This test is called an arterial blood gas test.\n                \nBronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) is a procedure used to look inside the lungs' airways. If you're in the hospital and treatment with antibiotics isn't working well, your doctor may use this procedure.\n                \nYour doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into the airways. The tube has a light and small camera that allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways and take pictures.\n                \nYour doctor can see whether something is blocking your airways or whether another factor is contributing to your pneumonia."

Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.\n                \nAlthough you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.\n                \nBacterial Pneumonia\n                \nBacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.\n                \nMost people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.\n                \nViral Pneumonia\n                \nAntibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.\n                \nViral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.\n                \nTreating Severe Symptoms\n                \nYou may need to be treated in a hospital if:\n                \nYour symptoms are severe\n                \nYou're at risk for complications because of other health problems\n                \nIf the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive oxygen therapy.

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia is a common, easily treated condition that occurs if you don't have enough iron in your body. Low iron levels usually are due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food.\n                \nOverview\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body.\n                \nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia usually develops over time if your body doesn't have enough iron to build healthy red blood cells. Without enough iron, your body starts using the iron it has stored. Soon, the stored iron gets used up.\n                \nAfter the stored iron is gone, your body makes fewer red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make have less hemoglobin than normal.\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia can cause fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms. Severe iron-deficiency anemia can lead to heart problems, infections, problems with growth and development in children, and other complications.\n                \nInfants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nDoctors usually can successfully treat iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment will depend on the cause and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes, medicines, and surgery.\n                \nSevere iron-deficiency anemia may require treatment in a hospital, blood transfusions, iron injections, or intravenous iron therapy."

Lack of iron usually is due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food.\n                \nBlood Loss\n                \nWhen you lose blood, you lose iron. If you don't have enough iron stored in your body to make up for the lost iron, you'll develop iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nIn women, long or heavy menstrual periods or bleeding fibroids in the uterus may cause low iron levels. Blood loss that occurs during childbirth is another cause of low iron levels in women.\n                \nInternal bleeding (bleeding inside the body) also may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. This type of blood loss isn't always obvious, and it may occur slowly. Some causes of internal bleeding are:\n                \nA bleeding ulcer, colon polyp, or colon cancer\n                \nRegular use of aspirin or other pain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen)\n                \nUrinary tract bleeding\n                \nBlood loss from severe injuries, surgery, or frequent blood drawings also can cause iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nPoor Diet\n                \nThe best sources of iron are meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified foods (foods that have iron added). If you don't eat these foods regularly, or if you don't take an iron supplement, you're more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nVegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables.\n                \nDuring some stages of life, such as pregnancy and childhood, it may be hard to get enough iron in your diet. This is because your need for iron increases during these times of growth and development.\n                \nInability To Absorb Enough Iron\n                \nEven if you have enough iron in your diet, your body may not be able to absorb it. This can happen if you have intestinal surgery (such as gastric bypass) or a disease of the intestine (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease).\n                \nPrescription medicines that reduce acid in the stomach also can interfere with iron absorption."

Talk with your child's doctor about your child's diet.\n                \nYoung children who drink a lot of cow's milk may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Milk is low in iron, and too much milk may take the place of iron-rich foods in the diet. Too much milk also may prevent children's bodies from absorbing iron from other foods.\n                \nChildren who have lead in their blood also may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Lead can interfere with the body's ability to make hemoglobin. Lead may get into the body from breathing in lead dust, eating lead in paint or soil, or drinking water that contains lead.\n                \nTeens\n                \nTeens are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia if they're underweight or have chronic (ongoing) illnesses. Teenage girls who have heavy periods also are at increased risk for the condition.\n                \nWomen\n                \nWomen of childbearing age are at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss during their monthly periods. About 1 in 5 women of childbearing age has iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nPregnant women also are at higher risk for the condition because they need twice as much iron as usual. The extra iron is needed for increased blood volume and for the fetus' growth.\n                \nAbout half of all pregnant women develop iron-deficiency anemia. The condition can increase a pregnant woman's risk for a premature or low-birth-weight baby.\n                \nAdults Who Have Internal Bleeding\n                \nAdults who have internal bleeding, such as intestinal bleeding, can develop iron-deficiency anemia due to blood loss. Certain conditions, such as colon cancer and bleeding ulcers, can cause blood loss. Some medicines, such as aspirin, also can cause internal bleeding.\n                \nOther At-Risk Groups\n                \nPeople who get kidney dialysis treatment may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This is because blood is lost during dialysis. Also, the kidneys are no longer able to make enough of a hormone that the body needs to produce red blood cells.\n                \nPeople who have gastric bypass surgery also may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This type of surgery can prevent the body from absorbing enough iron.\n                \nCertain eating patterns or habits may put you at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia. This can happen if you:\n                \nFollow a diet that excludes meat and fish, which are the best sources of iron. However, vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables.\n                \nEat poorly because of money, social, health, or other problems.\n                \nFollow a very low-fat diet over a long time. Some higher fat foods, like meat, are the best sources of iron.\n                \nFollow a high-fiber diet. Large amounts of fiber can slow the absorption of iron."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?",
            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia depend on its severity. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms.\n                \nWhen signs and symptoms do occur, they can range from mild to severe. Many of the signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia apply to all types of anemia.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Anemia\n                \nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts.\n                \nAlso, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n                \nAnemia also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, chest pain, weakness, and fatigue (tiredness).\n                \nIf you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\n                \nIn infants and young children, signs of anemia include poor appetite, slowed growth and development, and behavioral problems.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Iron Deficiency\n                \nSigns and symptoms of iron deficiency may include brittle nails, swelling or soreness of the tongue, cracks in the sides of the mouth, an enlarged spleen, and frequent infections.\n                \nPeople who have iron-deficiency anemia may have an unusual craving for nonfood items, such as ice, dirt, paint, or starch. This craving is called pica (PI-ka or PE-ka).\n                \nSome people who have iron-deficiency anemia develop restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move the legs. This urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in the legs. People who have RLS often have a hard time sleeping.\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia can put children at greater risk for lead poisoning and infections.\n                \nSome signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia are related to the condition's causes. For example, a sign of intestinal bleeding is bright red blood in the stools or black, tarry-looking stools.\n                \nVery heavy menstrual bleeding, long periods, or other vaginal bleeding may suggest that a woman is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia."

            "question": "How to diagnose Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose iron-deficiency anemia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nOnce your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you.\n                \nMild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms. Thus, you may not know you have it unless your doctor discovers it from a screening test or while checking for other problems.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctors often diagnose and treat iron-deficiency anemia. These doctors include pediatricians, family doctors, gynecologists/obstetricians, and internal medicine specialists.\n                \nA hematologist (a blood disease specialist), a gastroenterologist (a digestive system specialist), and other specialists also may help treat iron-deficiency anemia.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and any past problems you've had with anemia or low iron. He or she also may ask about your diet and whether you're taking any medicines.\n                \nIf you're a woman, your doctor may ask whether you might be pregnant.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of iron-deficiency anemia. He or she may:\n                \nLook at your skin, gums, and nail beds to see whether they're pale\n                \nListen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats\n                \nListen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing\n                \nFeel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen\n                \nDo a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nMany tests and procedures are used to diagnose iron-deficiency anemia. They can help confirm a diagnosis, look for a cause, and find out how severe the condition is.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\n                \nThis test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\n                \nThe normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of infection, a blood disorder, or another condition.\n                \nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal.\n                \nOther Blood Tests\n                \nIf the CBC results confirm you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what's causing the condition, how severe it is, and the best way to treat it.\n                \nReticulocyte count. This test measures the number of reticulocytes (re-TIK-u-lo-sites) in your blood. Reticulocytes are young, immature red blood cells. Over time, reticulocytes become mature red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body.\n                \nA reticulocyte count shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate.\n                \nPeripheral smear. For this test, a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal.\n                \nTests to measure iron levels. These tests can show how much iron has been used from your body's stored iron. Tests to measure iron levels include:\n                \nSerum iron. This test measures the amount of iron in your blood. The level of iron in your blood may be normal even if the total amount of iron in your body is low. For this reason, other iron tests also are done.\n                \nSerum ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that helps store iron in your body. A measure of this protein helps your doctor find out how much of your body's stored iron has been used.\n                \nTransferrin level, or total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood. Total iron-binding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you'll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron.\n                \nOther tests. Your doctor also may recommend tests to check your hormone levels, especially your thyroid hormone. You also may have a blood test for a chemical called erythrocyte protoporphyrin. This chemical is a building block for hemoglobin.\n                \nChildren also may be tested for the level of lead in their blood. Lead can make it hard for the body to produce hemoglobin.\n                \nTests and Procedures for Gastrointestinal Blood Loss\n                \nTo check whether internal bleeding is causing your iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor may suggest a fecal occult blood test. This test looks for blood in the stools and can detect bleeding in the intestines.\n                \nIf the test finds blood, you may have other tests and procedures to find the exact spot of the bleeding. These tests and procedures may look for bleeding in the stomach, upper intestines, colon, or pelvic organs."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for iron-deficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity. Treatments may include dietary changes and supplements, medicines, and surgery.\n                \nSevere iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous (IV) iron therapy. Treatment may need to be done in a hospital.\n                \nThe goals of treating iron-deficiency anemia are to treat its underlying cause and restore normal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and iron.\n                \nDietary Changes and Supplements\n                \nIron\n                \nYou may need iron supplements to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. Iron supplements can correct low iron levels within months. Supplements come in pill form or in drops for children.\n                \nLarge amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. Keep iron supplements out of reach from children. This will prevent them from taking an overdose of iron.\n                \nIron supplements can cause side effects, such as dark stools, stomach irritation, and heartburn. Iron also can cause constipation, so your doctor may suggest that you use a stool softener.\n                \nYour doctor may advise you to eat more foods that are rich in iron. The best source of iron is red meat, especially beef and liver. Chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish also are good sources of iron.\n                \nThe body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods. However, some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels. Examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:\n                \nIron-fortified breads and cereals\n                \nPeas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas\n                \nTofu\n                \nDried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots\n                \nSpinach and other dark green leafy vegetables\n                \nPrune juice\n                \nThe Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods will show how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.\n                \nVitamin C\n                \nVitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitamin C than canned ones.\n                \nIf you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. Grapefruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.\n                \nOther fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.\n                \nVegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.\n                \nTreatment To Stop Bleeding\n                \nIf blood loss is causing iron-deficiency anemia, treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding. For example, if you have a bleeding ulcer, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics and other medicines to treat the ulcer.\n                \nIf a polyp or cancerous tumor in your intestine is causing bleeding, you may need surgery to remove the growth.\n                \nIf you have heavy menstrual flow, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help reduce your monthly blood flow. In some cases, surgery may be advised.\n                \nTreatments for Severe Iron-Deficiency Anemia\n                \nBlood Transfusion\n                \nIf your iron-deficiency anemia is severe, you may get a transfusion of red blood cells. A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels. A transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\n                \nA transfusion of red blood cells will treat your anemia right away. The red blood cells also give a source of iron that your body can reuse. However, a blood transfusion is only a short-term treatment. Your doctor will need to find and treat the cause of your anemia.\n                \nBlood transfusions are usually reserved for people whose anemia puts them at a higher risk for heart problems or other severe health issues.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nIron Therapy\n                \nIf you have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend iron therapy. For this treatment, iron is injected into a muscle or an IV line in one of your blood vessels.\n                \nIV iron therapy presents some safety concerns. It must be done in a hospital or clinic by experienced staff. Iron therapy usually is given to people who need iron long-term but can't take iron supplements by mouth. This therapy also is given to people who need immediate treatment for iron-deficiency anemia."

Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes.\n                \nFor more information about diet and supplements, go to \"How Is Iron-Deficiency Anemia Treated?\"\n                \nInfants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Special measures can help prevent the condition in these groups.\n                \nInfants and Young Children\n                \nA baby's diet can affect his or her risk for iron-deficiency anemia. For example, cow's milk is low in iron. For this and other reasons, cow's milk isn't recommended for babies in their first year. After the first year, you may need to limit the amount of cow's milk your baby drinks.\n                \nAlso, babies need more iron as they grow and begin to eat solid foods. Talk with your child's doctor about a healthy diet and food choices that will help your child get enough iron.\n                \nYour child's doctor may recommend iron drops. However, giving a child too much iron can be harmful. Follow the doctor's instructions and keep iron supplements and vitamins away from children. Asking for child-proof packages for supplements can help prevent overdosing in children.\n                \nBecause recent research supports concerns that iron deficiency during infancy and childhood can have long-lasting, negative effects on brain health, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends testing all infants for anemia at 1 year of age.\n                \nWomen and Girls\n                \nWomen of childbearing age may be tested for iron-deficiency anemia, especially if they have:\n                \nA history of iron-deficiency anemia\n                \nHeavy blood loss during their monthly periods\n                \nOther risk factors for iron-deficiency anemia\n                \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for who should be screened for iron deficiency, and how often:\n                \nGirls aged 12 to 18 and women of childbearing age who are not pregnant: Every 5 to 10 years.\n                \nWomen who have risk factors for iron deficiency: Once a year.\n                \nPregnant women: At the first prenatal visit.\n                \nFor pregnant women, medical care during pregnancy usually includes screening for anemia. Also, your doctor may prescribe iron supplements or advise you to eat more iron-rich foods.This not only will help you avoid iron-deficiency anemia, but also may lower your risk of having a low-birth-weight baby."

            "answer": "Bronchopulmonary (BRONG-ko-PUL-mo-NAR-e) dysplasia (dis-PLA-ze-ah), or BPD, is a serious lung condition that affects infants. BPD mostly affects premature infants who need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube).\n                \nMost infants who develop BPD are born more than 10 weeks before their due dates, weigh less than 2 pounds (about 1,000 grams) at birth, and have breathing problems. Infections that occur before or shortly after birth also can contribute to BPD.\n                \nSome infants who have BPD may need long-term breathing support from nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machines or ventilators.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMany babies who develop BPD are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a breathing disorder that mostly affects premature newborns. These infants' lungs aren't fully formed or aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant).\n                \nSurfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\n                \nWithout surfactant, the lungs collapse, and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. Without proper treatment, the lack of oxygen may damage the infant's brain and other organs.\n                \nBabies who have RDS are treated with surfactant replacement therapy. They also may need oxygen therapy. Shortly after birth, some babies who have RDS also are treated with NCPAP or ventilators (machines that support breathing).\n                \nOften, the symptoms of RDS start to improve slowly after about a week. However, some babies get worse and need more oxygen or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.\n                \nIf premature infants still require oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates, they're diagnosed with BPD.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAdvances in care now make it possible for more premature infants to survive. However, these infants are at high risk for BPD.\n                \nMost babies who have BPD get better in time, but they may need treatment for months or even years. They may continue to have lung problems throughout childhood and even into adulthood. There's some concern about whether people who had BPD as babies can ever have normal lung function.\n                \nAs children who have BPD grow, their parents can help reduce the risk of BPD complications. Parents can encourage healthy eating habits and good nutrition. They also can avoid cigarette smoke and other lung irritants."

            "question": "What causes Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) develops as a result of an infant's lungs becoming irritated or inflamed.\n                \nThe lungs of premature infants are fragile and often aren't fully developed. They can easily be irritated or injured within hours or days of birth. Many factors can damage premature infants' lungs.\n                \nVentilation\n                \nNewborns who have breathing problems or can't breathe on their own may need ventilator support. Ventilators are machines that use pressure to blow air into the airways and lungs.\n                \nAlthough ventilator support can help premature infants survive, the machine's pressure might irritate and harm the babies' lungs. For this reason, doctors only recommend ventilator support when necessary.\n                \nHigh Levels of Oxygen\n                \nNewborns who have breathing problems might need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube). This treatment helps the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.\n                \nHowever, high levels of oxygen can inflame the lining of the lungs and injure the airways. Also, high levels of oxygen can slow lung development in premature infants.\n                \nInfections\n                \nInfections can inflame the lungs. As a result, the airways narrow, which makes it harder for premature infants to breathe. Lung infections also increase the babies' need for extra oxygen and breathing support.\n                \nHeredity\n                \nStudies show that heredity may play a role in causing BPD. More studies are needed to confirm this finding."

            "answer": "Many babies who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The signs and symptoms of RDS at birth are:\n                \nRapid, shallow breathing\n                \nSharp pulling in of the chest below and between the ribs with each breath\n                \nGrunting sounds\n                \nFlaring of the nostrils\n                \nBabies who have RDS are treated with surfactant replacement therapy. They also may need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube).\n                \nShortly after birth, some babies who have RDS also are treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or ventilators (machines that support breathing).\n                \nOften, the symptoms of RDS start to improve slowly after about a week. However, some babies get worse and need more oxygen or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.\n                \nA first sign of BPD is when premature infantsusually those born more than 10 weeks earlystill need oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates. These babies are diagnosed with BPD.\n                \nInfants who have severe BPD may have trouble feeding, which can lead to delayed growth. These babies also may develop:\n                \nPulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n                \nCor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale is failure of the right side of the heart. Ongoing high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and the lower right chamber of the heart causes this condition."

            "question": "How to diagnose Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "Infants who are born earlyusually more than 10 weeks before their due datesand still need oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).\n                \nBPD can be mild, moderate, or severe. The diagnosis depends on how much extra oxygen a baby needs at the time of his or her original due date. It also depends on how long the baby needs oxygen therapy.\n                \nTo help confirm a diagnosis of BPD, doctors may recommend tests, such as:\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. In severe cases of BPD, this test may show large areas of air and signs of inflammation or infection in the lungs. A chest x ray also can detect problems (such as a collapsed lung) and show whether the lungs aren't developing normally.\n                \nBlood tests. Blood tests are used to see whether an infant has enough oxygen in his or her blood. Blood tests also can help determine whether an infection is causing an infant's breathing problems.\n                \nEchocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. Echocardiography is used to rule out heart defects or pulmonary hypertension as the cause of an infant's breathing problems"

            "question": "What are the treatments for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?",
            "answer": "Preventive Measures\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.\n                \nThe medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep the lungs open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\n                \nCorticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.\n                \nPremature babies who have very low birth weights also might be given corticosteroids within the first few days of birth. Doctors sometimes prescribe inhaled nitric oxide shortly after birth for babies who have very low birth weights. This treatment can help improve the babies' lung function.\n                \nThese preventive measures may help reduce infants' risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to BPD.\n                \nTreatment for Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n                \nThe goals of treating infants who have RDS include:\n                \nReducing further injury to the lungs\n                \nProviding nutrition and other support to help the lungs grow and recover\n                \nPreventing lung infections by giving antibiotics\n                \nTreatment of RDS usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room. Most infants who have signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.\n                \nTreatments for RDS include surfactant replacement therapy, breathing support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or a ventilator, oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube), and medicines to treat fluid buildup in the lungs.\n                \nFor more information about RDS treatments, go to the Health Topics Respiratory Distress Syndrome article.\n                \nTreatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia\n                \nTreatment in the NICU is designed to limit stress on infants and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Once doctors diagnose BPD, some or all of the treatments used for RDS will continue in the NICU.\n                \nSuch treatment usually includes:\n                \nUsing radiant warmers or incubators to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.\n                \nOngoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.\n                \nUsing sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.\n                \nGiving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is vital to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.\n                \nChecking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.\n                \nAs BPD improves, babies are slowly weaned off NCPAP or ventilators until they can breathe on their own. These infants will likely need oxygen therapy for some time.\n                \nIf your infant has moderate or severe BPD, echocardiography might be done every few weeks to months to check his or her pulmonary artery pressure.\n                \nIf your child needs long-term ventilator support, he or she will likely get a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). A tracheostomy is a surgically made hole. It goes through the front of the neck and into the trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. Your child's doctor will put the breathing tube from the ventilator through the hole.\n                \nUsing a tracheostomy instead of an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube has some advantages. (An endotracheal tube is a breathing tube inserted through the nose or mouth and into the windpipe.)\n                \nLong-term use of an endotracheal tube can damage the trachea. This damage may need to be corrected with surgery later. A tracheostomy can allow your baby to interact more with you and the NICU staff, start talking, and develop other skills.\n                \nWhile your baby is in the NICU, he or she also may need physical therapy. Physical therapy can help strengthen your child's muscles and clear mucus out of his or her lungs.\n                \nInfants who have BPD may spend several weeks or months in the hospital. This allows them to get the care they need.\n                \nBefore your baby goes home, learn as much as you can about your child's condition and how it's treated. Your baby may continue to have some breathing symptoms after he or she leaves the hospital.\n                \nYour child will likely continue on all or some of the treatments that were started at the hospital, including:\n                \nMedicines, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and diuretics.\n                \nOxygen therapy or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.\n                \nExtra nutrition and calories, which may be given through a feeding tube.\n                \nPreventive treatment with a medicine called palivizumab for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This common virus leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older, healthy children. However, in infantsespecially those in high-risk groupsRSV can lead to severe breathing problems.\n                \nYour child also should have regular checkups with and timely vaccinations from a pediatrician. This is a doctor who specializes in treating children. If your child needs oxygen therapy or a ventilator at home, a pulmonary specialist might be involved in his or her care.\n                \nSeek out support from family, friends, and hospital staff. Ask the case manager or social worker at the hospital about what you'll need after your baby leaves the hospital.\n                \nThe doctors and nurses can assist with questions about your infant's care. Also, you may want to ask whether your community has a support group for parents of premature infants."

            "answer": "Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. These steps include:\n                \nSeeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet\n                \nNot smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs\n                \nControlling any ongoing medical conditions you have\n                \nPreventing infection\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.\n                \nThe medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby.

            "question": "What is (are) Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?",
            "answer": "Pleurisy (PLUR-ih-se) is a condition in which the pleura is inflamed. The pleura is a membrane that consists of two large, thin layers of tissue. One layer wraps around the outside of your lungs. The other layer lines the inside of your chest cavity.\n                \nBetween the layers of tissue is a very thin space called the pleural space. Normally this space is filled with a small amount of fluidabout 4 teaspoons full. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as you breathe in and out.\n                \nPleurisy occurs if the two layers of the pleura become irritated and inflamed. Instead of gliding smoothly past each other, they rub together every time you breathe in. The rubbing can cause sharp pain.\n                \nMany conditions can cause pleurisy, including viral infections.\n                \nOther Pleural Disorders\n                \nPneumothorax\n                \nAir or gas can build up in the pleural space. When this happens, it's called a pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks). A lung disease or acute lung injury can cause a pneumothorax.\n                \nSome lung procedures also can cause a pneumothorax. Examples include lung surgery, drainage of fluid with a needle,bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee), andmechanical ventilation.\n                \nSometimes the cause of a pneumothorax isn't known.\n                \nThe most common symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. The air or gas in the pleural space also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse.\n                \nPleurisy and Pneumothorax\n                \n\n                \nA small pneumothorax may go away without treatment. A large pneumothorax may require a procedure to remove air or gas from the pleural space.\n                \nA very large pneumothorax can interfere with blood flow through your chest and cause your blood pressure to drop. This is called a tension pneumothorax.\n                \nPleural Effusion\n                \nIn some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a pleural effusion. A lot of extra fluid can push the pleura against your lung until the lung, or part of it, collapses. This can make it hard for you to breathe.\n                \nSometimes the extra fluid gets infected and turns into an abscess. When this happens, it's called an empyema (em-pi-E-ma).\n                \nYou can develop a pleural effusion even if you don't have pleurisy. For example,pneumonia, (nu-MO-ne-ah),heart failure, cancer, or pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm) can lead to a pleural effusion.\n                \nHemothorax\n                \nBlood also can build up in the pleural space. This condition is called a hemothorax (he-mo-THOR-aks). An injury to your chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax.\n                \nA hemothorax can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. A hemothorax also can cause shock. In shock, not enough blood and oxygen reach your body's vital organs.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPleurisy and other pleural disorders can be serious, depending on their causes. If the condition that caused the pleurisy or other pleural disorder isn't too serious and is diagnosed and treated early, you usually can expect a full recovery."

Reactions to certain medicines can cause a condition similar to lupus. These medicines include procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid.\n                \nSometimes doctors can't find the cause of pleurisy.\n                \nPneumothorax\n                \nLung diseases or acute lung injury can make it more likely that you will develop a pneumothorax (a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space). Such lung diseases may include COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), tuberculosis, and LAM.\n                \nSurgery or a chest injury also may cause a pneumothorax.\n                \nYou can develop a pneumothorax without having a recognized lung disease or chest injury. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. Smoking increases your risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. Having a family history of the condition also increases your risk.\n                \nPleural Effusion\n                \nThe most common cause of a pleural effusion (a buildup of fluid in the pleural space) is heart failure. Lung cancer, LAM, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other lung infections also can lead to a pleural effusion.\n                \nSometimes kidney or liver disease can cause fluid to build up in the pleural space. Asbestosis, sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis), and reactions to some medicines also can lead to a pleural effusion.\n                \nHemothorax\n                \nAn injury to the chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax (buildup of blood in the pleural space).\n                \nA hemothorax also can be a complication of an infection (for example, pneumonia), tuberculosis, or a spontaneous pneumothorax."

He or she also will want to find the underlying cause of the pleurisy or other pleural disorder so it can be treated.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask detailed questions about your medical history. He or she likely will ask you to describe any pain, especially:\n                \nWhat it feels like\n                \nWhere it's located and whether you can feel it in your arms, jaw, or shoulders\n                \nWhen it started and whether it goes away and then comes back\n                \nWhat makes it better or worse\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, or palpitations. Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you've ever:\n                \nHad heart disease.\n                \nSmoked.\n                \nTraveled to places where you may have been exposed to tuberculosis.\n                \nHad a job that exposed you to asbestos. Asbestos is a mineral that, at one time, was widely used in many industries.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask about medicines you take or have taken. Reactions to some medicines can cause pleurisy or other pleural disorders. \n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any abnormal sounds.\n                \nIf you have pleurisy, the inflamed layers of the pleura make a rough, scratchy sound as they rub against each other when you breathe. Doctors call this a pleural friction rub. If your doctor hears the friction rub, he or she will know that you have pleurisy.\n                \nIf you have a pleural effusion, fluid buildup in the pleural space will prevent a friction rub. But if you have a lot of fluid, your doctor may hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. Or, he or she may have trouble hearing any breathing sounds.\n                \nMuffled or dull breathing sounds also can be a sign of a pneumothorax (a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space).\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nDepending on the results of your physical exam, your doctor may recommend tests.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nAchest x rayis a painless test that creates a picture of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test may show air or fluid in the pleural space.\n                \nA chest x ray also may show what's causing a pleural disorderfor example, pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor.\n                \nSometimes a chest x ray is taken while you lie on your side. This position can show fluid that didn't appear on an x ray taken while you were standing.\n                \nChest CT Scan\n                \nA chest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, orchest CT scan,is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures in your chest.\n                \nThis test provides a computer-generated picture of your lungs that can show pockets of fluid. A chest CT scan also may show signs of pneumonia, a lung abscess, a tumor, or other possible causes of pleural disorders.\n                \nUltrasound\n                \nThis test uses sound waves to create pictures of your lungs. An ultrasound may show where fluid is located in your chest. The test also can show some tumors.\n                \nChest MRI\n                \nA chest magnetic resonance imaging scan, orchest MRI,uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to created detailed pictures of the structures in your chest. This test can show pleural effusions and tumors.\n                \nThis test also is called a magnetic resonance (MR) scan or a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scan.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood testscan show whether you have an illness that increases your risk of pleurisy or another pleural disorder. Such illnesses include bacterial or viral infections, pneumonia, pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas), kidney disease, or lupus.\n                \nArterial Blood Gas Test\n                \nFor this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The blood's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are checked. This test shows how well your lungs are taking in oxygen.\n                \nThoracentesis\n                \nOnce your doctor knows whether fluid has built up in the pleural space and where it is, he or she can remove a sample for testing. This is done using a procedure calledthoracentesis(THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis).\n                \nDuring the procedure, your doctor inserts a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space and draws out the excess fluid. After the fluid is removed from your chest, it's sent for testing.\n                \nThe risks of thoracentesissuch as pain, bleeding, and infectionusually are minor. They get better on their own, or they're easily treated. Your doctor may do a chest x ray after the procedure to check for complications.\n                \nFluid Analysis\n                \nThe fluid removed during thoracentesis is examined under a microscope. It's checked for signs of infection, cancer, or other conditions that can cause fluid or blood to build up in the pleural space.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nYour doctor may suspect that tuberculosis or cancer has caused fluid to build up in your pleural space. If so, he or she may want to look at a small piece of the pleura under a microscope.\n                \nTo take a tissue sample, your doctor may do one of the following procedures:\n                \nInsert a needle into your chest to remove a small sample of the pleura's outer layer.\n                \nInsert a tube with a light on the end (endoscope) into tiny cuts in your chest wall so that he or she can see the pleura. Your doctor can then snip out small pieces of tissue. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure.\n                \nSnip out a sample of the pleura through a small cut in your chest wall. This is called an open pleural biopsy. It's usually done if the sample from the needle biopsy is too small for an accurate diagnosis. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?",
            "answer": "Pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. The goals of treatment include:\n                \nRelieving symptoms\n                \nRemoving the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space (if a large amount is present)\n                \nTreating the underlying condition\n                \nRelieving Symptoms\n                \nTo relieve pleurisy symptoms, your doctor may recommend:\n                \nAcetaminophen or anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) to control pain.\n                \nCodeine-based cough syrups to controlcoughing.\n                \nLying on your painful side. This might make you more comfortable.\n                \nBreathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, you may developpneumonia.\n                \nGetting plenty of rest.\n                \nRemoving Fluid, Air, or Blood From the Pleural Space\n                \nYour doctor may recommend removing fluid, air, or blood from your pleural space to prevent a lung collapse.\n                \nThe procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are similar.\n                \nDuringthoracentesis, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space. An attached syringe will draw fluid out of your chest. This procedure can remove more than 6 cups of fluid at a time.\n                \nIf your doctor needs to remove a lot of fluid, he or she may use a chest tube. Your doctor will inject a painkiller into the area of your chest wall where the fluid is. He or she will then insert a plastic tube into your chest between two ribs. The tube will be connected to a box that suctions out the fluid. Your doctor will use achest x ray to check the tube's position.\n                \nYour doctor also can use a chest tube to drain blood and air from the pleural space. This process can take several days. The tube will be left in place, and you'll likely stay in the hospital during this time.\n                \nSometimes the fluid in the pleural space contains thick pus or blood clots. It may form a hard skin or peel, which makes the fluid harder to drain. To help break up the pus or blood clots, your doctor may use a chest tube to deliver medicines called fibrinolytics to the pleural space. If the fluid still won't drain, you may need surgery.\n                \nIf you have a small, persistent air leak into the pleural space, your doctor may attach a one-way valve to the chest tube. The valve allows air to exit the pleural space, but not reenter. Using this type of valve may allow you to continue your treatment from home.\n                \nTreat the Underlying Condition\n                \nThe fluid sample that was removed during thoracentesis will be checked under a microscope. This can tell your doctor what's causing the fluid buildup, and he or she can decide the best way to treat it.\n                \nIf the fluid is infected, treatment will involve antibiotics and drainage. If you have tuberculosis or a fungal infection, treatment will involve long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines.\n                \nIf tumors in the pleura are causing fluid buildup, the fluid may quickly build up again after it's drained. Sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. If they don't, your doctor may seal the pleural space. Sealing the pleural space is called pleurodesis (plur-OD-eh-sis).\n                \nFor this procedure, your doctor will drain all of the fluid out of your chest through a chest tube. Then he or she will push a substance through the chest tube into the pleural space. The substance will irritate the surface of the pleura. This will cause the two layers of the pleura to stick together, preventing more fluid from building up.\n                \nChemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors.\n                \nIfheart failureis causing fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics (medicines that help reduce fluid buildup) and other medicines."

            "question": "What is (are) Cardiogenic Shock ?",
            "answer": "Cardiogenic (kar-dee-oh-JE-nik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away.\n                \nThe most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. However, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. In fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition.\n                \nIf cardiogenic shock does occur, it's very dangerous. When people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death.\n                \nWhat Is Shock?\n                \nThe medical term \"shock\" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. Shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening.\n                \nShock can have many causes. Cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. Other types of shock include hypovolemic (hy-po-vo-LEE-mik) shock and vasodilatory (VAZ-oh-DILE-ah-tor-e) shock.\n                \nHypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss.\n                \nIn vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. When the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. Without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs.\n                \nA bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock.\n                \nWhen a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body's organs. If shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. If shock isn't treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death.\n                \nSome of the signs and symptoms of shock include:\n                \nConfusion or lack of alertness\n                \nLoss of consciousness\n                \nA sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat\n                \nSweating\n                \nPale skin\n                \nA weak pulse\n                \nRapid breathing\n                \nDecreased or no urine output\n                \nCool hands and feet\n                \nIf you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIn the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. Now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. This is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices. These treatments can restore blood flow to the heart and help the heart pump better.\n                \nIn some cases, devices that take over the pumping function of the heart are used. Implanting these devices requires major surgery."

            "question": "What causes Cardiogenic Shock ?",
            "answer": "Immediate Causes\n                \nCardiogenic shock occurs if the heart suddenly can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack.\n                \nThis damage prevents the hearts main pumping chamber, the left ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), from working well. As a result, the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\n                \nIn about 3 percent of cardiogenic shock cases, the hearts lower right chamber, the right ventricle, doesnt work well. This means the heart can't properly pump blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen to bring back to the heart and the rest of the body.\n                \nWithout enough oxygen-rich blood reaching the bodys major organs, many problems can occur. For example:\n                \nCardiogenic shock can cause death if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs isn't restored quickly. This is why emergency medical treatment is required.\n                \nIf organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood, they won't work well. Cells in the organs die, and the organs may never work well again.\n                \nAs some organs stop working, they may cause problems with other bodily functions. This, in turn, can worsen shock. For example:   - If the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more.   - If the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss.\n                \nIf the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more.\n                \nIf the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss.\n                \nHow well the brain, kidneys, and other organs recover will depend on how long a person is in shock. The less time a person is in shock, the less damage will occur to the organs. This is another reason why emergency treatment is so important.\n                \nUnderlying Causes\n                \nThe underlying causes of cardiogenic shock are conditions that weaken the heart and prevent it from pumping enough oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n                \nHeart Attack\n                \nMost heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) narrows or blocks the coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nPlaque reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. It also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nConditions Caused by Heart Attack\n                \nHeart attacks can cause some serious heart conditions that can lead to cardiogenic shock. One example is ventricular septal rupture. This condition occurs if the wall that separates the ventricles (the hearts two lower chambers) breaks down.\n                \nThe breakdown happens because cells in the wall have died due to a heart attack. Without the wall to separate them, the ventricles cant pump properly.\n                \nHeart attacks also can cause papillary muscle infarction or rupture. This condition occurs if the muscles that help anchor the heart valves stop working or break because a heart attack cuts off their blood supply. If this happens, blood doesn't flow correctly between the hearts chambers. This prevents the heart from pumping properly.\n                \nOther Heart Conditions\n                \nSerious heart conditions that may occur with or without a heart attack can cause cardiogenic shock. Examples include:\n                \nMyocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis). This is inflammation of the heart muscle.\n                \nEndocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.\n                \nLife-threatening arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). These are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nPericardial tamponade (per-ih-KAR-de-al tam-po-NADE). This is too much fluid or blood around the heart. The fluid squeezes the heart muscle so it can't pump properly.\n                \nPulmonary Embolism\n                \nPulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. This condition usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg. PE can damage your heart and other organs in your body."

            "question": "How to diagnose Cardiogenic Shock ?",
            "answer": "The first step in diagnosing cardiogenic shock is to identify that a person is in shock. At that point, emergency treatment should begin.\n                \nOnce emergency treatment starts, doctors can look for the specific cause of the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.\n                \nTests and Procedures To Diagnose Shock and Its Underlying Causes\n                \nBlood Pressure Test\n                \nMedical personnel can use a simple blood pressure cuff and stethoscope to check whether a person has very low blood pressure. This is the most common sign of shock. A blood pressure test can be done before the person goes to a hospital.\n                \nLess serious conditions also can cause low blood pressure, such as fainting or taking certain medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular).\n                \nAn EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. Doctors use EKGs to diagnose severe heart attacks and monitor the heart's condition.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of the heart and how well the heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of organs and structures in the chest, including the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test shows whether the heart is enlarged or whether fluid is present in the lungs. These can be signs of cardiogenic shock.\n                \nCardiac Enzyme Test\n                \nWhen cells in the heart die, they release enzymes into the blood. These enzymes are called markers or biomarkers. Measuring these markers can show whether the heart is damaged and the extent of the damage.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is an x-ray exam of the heart and blood vessels. The doctor passes a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery in the leg or arm to the heart. The catheter can measure the pressure inside the heart chambers.\n                \nDye that can be seen on an x-ray image is injected into the bloodstream through the tip of the catheter. The dye lets the doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels and see any blockages.\n                \nPulmonary Artery Catheterization\n                \nFor this procedure, a catheter is inserted into a vein in the arm or neck or near the collarbone. Then, the catheter is moved into the pulmonary artery. This artery connects the right side of the heart to the lungs.\n                \nThe catheter is used to check blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. If the blood pressure is too high or too low, treatment may be needed.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nSome blood tests also are used to help diagnose cardiogenic shock, including:\n                \nArterial blood gas measurement. For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery. The sample is used to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH (acidity) levels in the blood. Certain levels of these substances are associated with shock.\n                \nTests that measure the function of various organs, such as the kidneys and liver. If these organs aren't working well, they may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. This could be a sign of cardiogenic shock."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Cardiogenic Shock ?",
            "answer": "Cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment. The condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. If the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive.\n                \nThe first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs.\n                \nSometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. For example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. Often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment.\n                \nEmergency Life Support\n                \nEmergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. This treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs.\n                \nRestoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. Emergency life support treatment includes:\n                \nGiving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body.\n                \nProviding breathing support if needed. A ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.\n                \nGiving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). This can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. This treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. Also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nDuring and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.\n                \nTreatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. Doctors may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming\n                \nIncrease the force with which the heart muscle contracts\n                \nTreat a heart attack\n                \nMedical Devices\n                \nMedical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. Devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include:\n                \nAn intra-aortic balloon pump. This device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. A balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. This allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys.\n                \nA left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. An LVAD helps the heart pump blood to the body. This device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nSometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock.\n                \nMedical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock.\n                \nSurgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. Surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival.\n                \nThe types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include:\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stents. PCI,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. A stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during PCI to help keep it open.\n                \nCoronary artery bypass grafting. For this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. This creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart.\n                \nSurgery to repair damaged heart valves.\n                \nSurgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. This break is called a septal rupture.\n                \nHeart transplant. This type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. Also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. Still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nDeep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together.\n                \nMost deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body.\n                \nA blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE.\n                \nPE is a very serious condition. It can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death.\n                \nBlood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause PE than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. Blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface. However, these clots won't break off and cause PE.\n                \nThe animation below shows a deep vein blood clot.

            "question": "How to diagnose Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will identify your risk factors and rule out other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nFor some people, DVT might not be diagnosed until after they receive emergency treatment for pulmonary embolism (PE).\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTo learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about:\n                \nYour overall health\n                \nAny prescription medicines you're taking\n                \nAny recent surgeries or injuries you've had\n                \nWhether you've been treated for cancer\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check your legs for signs of DVT, such as swelling or redness. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests to find out whether you have DVT.\n                \nCommon Tests\n                \nThe most common test for diagnosing deep vein blood clots is ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of blood flowing through the arteries and veins in the affected leg.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a D-dimer test or venography (ve-NOG-rah-fee).\n                \nA D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot dissolves. If the test shows high levels of the substance, you may have a deep vein blood clot. If your test results are normal and you have few risk factors, DVT isn't likely.\n                \nYour doctor may suggest venography if an ultrasound doesn't provide a clear diagnosis. For venography, dye is injected into a vein in the affected leg. The dye makes the vein visible on an x-ray image. The x ray will show whether blood flow is slow in the vein, which may suggest a blood clot.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests used to diagnose DVT include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee), or CT, scanning. These tests create pictures of your organs and tissues.\n                \nYou may need blood tests to check whether you have an inherited blood clotting disorder that can cause DVT. This may be the case if you have repeated blood clots that are not related to another cause. Blood clots in an unusual location (such as the liver, kidney, or brain) also may suggest an inherited clotting disorder.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have PE, he or she may recommend more tests, such as a lung ventilation perfusion scan (VQ scan). A lung VQ scan shows how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of the lungs.\n                \nFor more information about diagnosing PE, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Embolism article."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
            "answer": "Doctors treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with medicines and other devices and therapies. The main goals of treating DVT are to:\n                \nStop the blood clot from getting bigger\n                \nPrevent the blood clot from breaking off and moving to your lungs\n                \nReduce your chance of having another blood clot\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent or treat DVT.\n                \nAnticoagulants\n                \nAnticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants) are the most common medicines for treating DVT. They're also known as blood thinners.\n                \nThese medicines decrease your blood's ability to clot. They also stop existing blood clots from getting bigger. However, blood thinners can't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most blood clots with time.)\n                \nBlood thinners can be taken as a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).\n                \nWarfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat DVT. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.\n                \nYour doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.\n                \nPregnant women usually are treated with just heparin because warfarin is dangerous during pregnancy.\n                \nTreatment for DVT using blood thinners usually lasts for 6 months. The following situations may change the length of treatment:\n                \nIf your blood clot occurred after a short-term risk (for example, surgery), your treatment time may be shorter.\n                \nIf you've had blood clots before, your treatment time may be longer.\n                \nIf you have certain other illnesses, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners for as long as you have the illness.\n                \nThe most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. Bleeding can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.\n                \nSometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually have regular blood tests to measure their blood's ability to clot. These tests are called PT and PTT tests.\n                \nThese tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you have easy bruising or bleeding. These may be signs that your medicines have thinned your blood too much.\n                \nThrombin Inhibitors\n                \nThese medicines interfere with the blood clotting process. They're used to treat blood clots in patients who can't take heparin.\n                \nThrombolytics\n                \nDoctors prescribe these medicines to quickly dissolve large blood clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations.\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nVena Cava Filter\n                \nIf you can't take blood thinners or they're not working well, your doctor may recommend a vena cava filter.\n                \nThe filter is inserted inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. However, the filter doesn't stop new blood clots from forming.\n                \nGraduated Compression Stockings\n                \nGraduated compression stockings can reduce leg swelling caused by a blood clot. These stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee.\n                \nCompression stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting.\n                \nThere are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose, which offer the least amount of pressure.\n                \nThe second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.\n                \nPrescription-strength compression hose offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, a specially trained person needs to fit you for these stockings.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about how long you should wear compression stockings."

            "question": "What is (are) Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?",
            "answer": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-NI-tis), or HP, is a disease in which the lungs become inflamed from breathing in foreign substances, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals. These substances also are known as antigens (AN-tih-jens).\n                \nPeople are exposed to antigens at home, while at work, and in other settings. However, most people who breathe in these substances don't develop HP.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand HP, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nSmall blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body.\n                \nIn HP, the air sacs become inflamed and may fill with fluid. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sacs and into the bloodstream.\n                \nThe two main types of HP are acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing). Both types can develop as a result of repeatedly breathing in an antigen.\n                \nOver time, your lungs can become sensitive to that antigen. If this happens, they'll become inflamed, which can lead to symptoms and may even cause long-term lung damage.\n                \nWith acute HP, symptoms usually occur within 29 hours of exposure to an antigen you're sensitive to. Acute HP can cause chills, body aches, coughing, and chest tightness. After hours or days of no contact with the antigen, symptoms usually go away.\n                \nIf acute HP isn't found and treated early, chronic HP may develop. Symptoms of chronic HP occur slowly, over months. Chronic HP can cause a worsening cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss. Severe HP may cause clubbing (a widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes).\n                \nWith chronic HP, symptoms may continue and/or worsen, even after avoiding the antigen. Sometimes, chronic HP can cause long-term lung damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis (PULL-mun-ary fi-BRO-sis). This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAvoiding or reducing your contact with antigens can help prevent and treat HP. For example, cleaning heating and ventilation filters can help reduce your contact with mold. Wetting compost prior to handling it can reduce contact with harmful dust.\n                \nIf HP is caught early, avoiding the antigen that caused it may be the only treatment you need. If you have chronic HP, your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce lung inflammation.\n                \nResearchers continue to study why some people develop HP after being exposed to antigens, while others don't. They're also looking for better ways to quickly pinpoint which antigens are causing HP in people who are believed to have the disease."

A low level of oxygen in the blood causes this condition.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nTo help diagnose HP, your doctor may recommend or more of the following tests or procedures.\n                \nChest X Ray or Chest Computed Tomography (CT) Scan\n                \nA chest x ray and chest CT scan create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of HP.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs can deliver oxygen to your blood. One of these tests is spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre).\n                \nDuring this test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath. Then, you'll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out.\n                \nPulse Oximetry\n                \nThis test measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\n                \nPrecipitin Test\n                \nThis blood test looks for antibodies (proteins) that your body creates in response to antigens. The presence of these proteins may suggest HP.\n                \nChallenge Test\n                \nDuring this test, you're re-exposed to the suspected antigen. Then, you'll be watched for signs and symptoms of HP.\n                \nBronchoscopy\n                \nFor bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee), your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. At the tip of the tube are a light and mini-camera. This allows your doctor to see your windpipe and airways.\n                \nYour doctor may insert forceps (a device used to grab or hold things) through the tube to collect a tissue sample. You'll be given medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy during the procedure.\n                \nBronchoalveolar Lavage\n                \nDuring bronchoscopy, your doctor may inject a small amount of salt water (saline) through the tube into your lungs. This method is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH).\n                \nThis fluid washes the lungs and helps bring up cells from the airways and the area around the air sacs. Your doctor will look at these cells under a microscope.\n                \nSurgical Lung Biopsy\n                \nTo confirm a diagnosis of HP, your doctor may do a surgical lung biopsy. Your doctor can use a biopsy to rule out other causes of symptoms and check the condition of your lungs.\n                \nFor a surgical lung biopsy, your doctor takes samples of lung tissue from several places in your lungs. He or she then looks at them under a microscope. Your doctor may use one of the following methods to get lung tissue samples.\n                \nVideo-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, your doctor inserts a small, lighted tube with a camera (endoscope) into your chest through small cuts between your ribs.\n                \nThe endoscope provides a video image of your lungs and allows your doctor to collect tissue samples. This procedure is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure.\n                \nThoracotomy (thor-ah-KOT-o-me). For this procedure, your doctor removes a few small pieces of lung tissue through a cut in the chest wall between your ribs. Thoracotomy is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?",
            "answer": "The best way to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is to avoid the antigen that caused it. (An antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.)\n                \nIn acute (short-term) HP, symptoms usually go away once you're no longer in contact with the antigen. In chronic (ongoing) HP, you may need medicines to relieve your symptoms.\n                \nPeople who have chronic HP may develop pulmonary fibrosis. This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. People who have this condition may need further treatment, such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab).\n                \nAvoiding Antigens\n                \nOnce the antigen that caused the HP and its source are found, you can take steps to avoid it. If HP is caught early, avoiding the antigen may be the only treatment you need.\n                \nAvoiding an antigen may be easier at home than at work. For example, if your pet bird, moldy carpet, or hot tub is the source of the antigen, you can remove it from your home. If your heating system is the source of the antigen, you can have your system properly serviced.\n                \nHowever, if the antigen is at work, you may need to talk with your supervisor about your condition and ways to protect yourself. For example, masks or personal respirators may help protect you from antigens in the air. (A personal respirator is a device that helps filter the air you breathe in.)\n                \nSome people who have HP may need to move to a different home or change jobs to avoid antigens. After hurricanes, for example, some people have to move from their homes to avoid molds that could harm their lungs. However, moving and changing jobs sometimes isn't possible.\n                \nMedicines and Other Treatments\n                \nIf you have chronic HP, your doctor may prescribe medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines reduce lung inflammation. Prednisone is an example of a corticosteroid.\n                \nLong-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Thus, if your doctor prescribes this medicine, he or she may reduce the dose over time.\n                \nExamples of side effects from corticosteroids are increased risk of infections, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and osteoporosis (thinning of the skin and bones).\n                \nPeople who develop pulmonary fibrosis may need medicines, oxygen therapy, and/or pulmonary rehab. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.\n                \nIf you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can make HP symptoms worse and lead to other lung diseases. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke."

            "question": "What is (are) Von Willebrand Disease ?",
            "answer": "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder. It affects your blood's ability to clot. If your blood doesn't clot, you can have heavy, hard-to-stop bleeding after an injury. The bleeding can damage your internal organs. Rarely, the bleeding may even cause death.\n                \nIn VWD, you either have low levels of a certain protein in your blood or the protein doesn't work well. The protein is called von Willebrand factor, and it helps your blood clot.\n                \nNormally, when one of your blood vessels is injured, you start to bleed. Small blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) clump together to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. Von Willebrand factor acts like glue to help the platelets stick together and form a blood clot.\n                \nVon Willebrand factor also carries clotting factor VIII (8), another important protein that helps your blood clot. Factor VIII is the protein that's missing or doesn't work well in people who have hemophilia, another bleeding disorder.\n                \nVWD is more common and usually milder than hemophilia. In fact, VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It occurs in about 1 out of every 100 to 1,000 people. VWD affects both males and females, while hemophilia mainly affects males.\n                \nTypes of von Willebrand Disease\n                \nThe three major types of VWD are called type 1, type 2, and type 3.\n                \nType 1\n                \nPeople who have type 1 VWD have low levels of von Willebrand factor and may have low levels of factor VIII. Type 1 is the mildest and most common form of VWD. About 3 out of 4 people who have VWD have type 1.\n                \nType 2\n                \nIn type 2 VWD, the von Willebrand factor doesn't work well. Type 2 is divided into subtypes: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. Different gene mutations (changes) cause each type, and each is treated differently. Thus, it's important to know the exact type of VWD that you have.\n                \nType 3\n                \nPeople who have type 3 VWD usually have no von Willebrand factor and low levels of factor VIII. Type 3 is the most serious form of VWD, but it's very rare.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMost people who have VWD have type 1, a mild form. This type usually doesn't cause life-threatening bleeding. You may need treatment only if you have surgery, tooth extraction, or trauma. Treatment includes medicines and medical therapies.\n                \nSome people who have severe forms of VWD need emergency treatment to stop bleeding before it becomes life threatening.\n                \nEarly diagnosis is important. With the proper treatment plan, even people who have type 3 VWD can live normal, active lives."

            "answer": "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is almost always inherited. \"Inherited\" means that the disorder is passed from parents to children though genes. \n                \nYou can inherit type 1 or type 2 VWD if only one of your parents passes the gene on to you. You usually inherit type 3 VWD only if both of your parents pass the gene on to you. Your symptoms may be different from your parents' symptoms.\n                \nSome people have the genes for the disorder but don't have symptoms. However, they still can pass the genes on to their children.\n                \nSome people get VWD later in life as a result of other medical conditions. This type of VWD is called acquired von Willebrand syndrome."

            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of von Willebrand disease (VWD) depend on which type of the disorder you have. They also depend on how serious the disorder is. Many people have such mild symptoms that they don't know they have VWD.\n                \nIf you have type 1 or type 2 VWD, you may have the following mild-to-moderate bleeding symptoms:\n                \nFrequent, large bruises from minor bumps or injuries\n                \nFrequent or hard-to-stop nosebleeds\n                \nProlonged bleeding from the gums after a dental procedure\n                \nHeavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women\n                \nBlood in your stools from bleeding in your intestines or stomach\n                \nBlood in your urine from bleeding in your kidneys or bladder\n                \nHeavy bleeding after a cut or other accident\n                \nHeavy bleeding after surgery\n                \nPeople who have type 3 VWD may have all of the symptoms listed above and severe bleeding episodes for no reason. These bleeding episodes can be fatal if not treated right away. People who have type 3 VWD also may have bleeding into soft tissues or joints, causing severe pain and swelling.\n                \nHeavy menstrual bleeding often is the main symptom of VWD in women. Doctors call this menorrhagia (men-o-RA-je-ah). They define it as:\n                \nBleeding with clots larger than about 1-inch in diameter\n                \nAnemia (low red blood cell count) or low blood iron\n                \nThe need to change pads or tampons more than every hour\n                \nHowever, just because a woman has heavy menstrual bleeding doesn't mean she has VWD."

            "answer": "Early diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is important to make sure that you're treated and can live a normal, active life.\n                \nSometimes VWD is hard to diagnose. People who have type 1 or type 2 VWD may not have major bleeding problems. Thus, they may not be diagnosed unless they have heavy bleeding after surgery or some other trauma.\n                \nOn the other hand, type 3 VWD can cause major bleeding problems during infancy and childhood. So, children who have type 3 VWD usually are diagnosed during their first year of life.\n                \nTo find out whether you have VWD, your doctor will review your medical history and the results from a physical exam and tests.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will likely ask questions about your medical history and your family's medical history. He or she may ask about:\n                \nAny bleeding from a small wound that lasted more than 15 minutes or started up again within the first 7 days following the injury.\n                \nAny prolonged, heavy, or repeated bleeding that required medical care after surgery or dental extractions.\n                \nAny bruising with little or no apparent trauma, especially if you could feel a lump under the bruise.\n                \nAny nosebleeds that occurred for no known reason and lasted more than 10 minutes despite pressure on the nose, or any nosebleeds that needed medical attention.\n                \nAny blood in your stools for no known reason.\n                \nAny heavy menstrual bleeding (for women). This bleeding usually involves clots or lasts longer than 7 to 10 days.\n                \nAny history of muscle or joint bleeding.\n                \nAny medicines you've taken that might cause bleeding or increase the risk of bleeding. Examples include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), clopidogrel, warfarin, or heparin.\n                \nAny history of liver or kidney disease, blood or bone marrow disease, or high or low blood platelet counts.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding. He or she also will look for signs of liver disease or anemia (a low red blood cell count).\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nNo single test can diagnose VWD. Your doctor may recommend one or more blood tests to diagnose the disorder. These tests may include:\n                \nVon Willebrand factor antigen. This test measures the amount of von Willebrand factor in your blood.\n                \nVon Willebrand factor ristocetin (ris-to-SEE-tin) cofactor activity. This test shows how well your von Willebrand factor works.\n                \nFactor VIII clotting activity. This test checks the clotting activity of factor VIII. Some people who have VWD have low levels of factor VIII activity, while others have normal levels.\n                \nVon Willebrand factor multimers. This test is done if one or more of the first three tests are abnormal. It shows the structure of your von Willebrand factor. The test helps your doctor diagnose what type of VWD you have.\n                \nPlatelet function test. This test measures how well your platelets are working.\n                \nYou may have these tests more than once to confirm a diagnosis. Your doctor also may refer you to a hematologist to confirm the diagnosis and for followup care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Von Willebrand Disease ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for von Willebrand disease (VWD) is based on the type of VWD you have and how severe it is. Most cases of VWD are mild, and you may need treatment only if you have surgery, tooth extraction, or an accident.\n                \nMedicines are used to:\n                \nIncrease the amount of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII released into the bloodstream\n                \nReplace von Willebrand factor\n                \nPrevent the breakdown of blood clots\n                \nControl heavy menstrual bleeding in women\n                \nSpecific Treatments\n                \nOne treatment for VWD is a man-made hormone called desmopressin. You usually take this hormone by injection or nasal spray. It makes your body release more von Willebrand factor and factor VIII into your bloodstream. Desmopressin works for most people who have type 1 VWD and for some people who have type 2 VWD.\n                \nAnother type of treatment is von Willebrand factor replacement therapy. This involves an infusion of concentrated von Willebrand factor and factor VIII into a vein in your arm. This treatment may be used if you:\n                \nCan't take desmopressin or need extended treatment\n                \nHave type 1 VWD that doesn't respond to desmopressin\n                \nHave type 2 or type 3 VWD\n                \nAntifibrinolytic (AN-te-fi-BRIN-o-LIT-ik) medicines also are used to treat VWD. These medicines help prevent the breakdown of blood clots. They're mostly used to stop bleeding after minor surgery, tooth extraction, or an injury. These medicines may be used alone or with desmopressin and replacement therapy.\n                \nFibrin glue is medicine that's placed directly on a wound to stop bleeding.\n                \nTreatments for Women\n                \nTreatments for women who have VWD with heavy menstrual bleeding include:\n                \nBirth control pills. The hormones in these pills can increase the amount of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII in your blood. The hormones also can reduce menstrual blood loss. Birth control pills are the most recommended birth control method for women who have VWD.\n                \nA levonorgestrel intrauterine device. This is a birth control device that contains the hormone progestin. The device is placed in the uterus (womb).\n                \nAminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. These antifibrinolytic medicines can reduce bleeding by slowing the breakdown of blood clots.\n                \nDesmopressin.\n                \nFor some women who are done having children or don't want children, endometrial ablation (EN-do-ME-tre-al ab-LA-shun) is done. This procedure destroys the lining of the uterus. It has been shown to reduce menstrual blood loss in women who have VWD.\n                \nIf you need a hysterectomy (HIS-ter-EK-to-me; surgical removal of the uterus) for another reason, this procedure will stop menstrual bleeding and possibly improve your quality of life. However, hysterectomy has its own risk of bleeding complications."

            "answer": "Lack of Energy Balance\n                \nA lack of energy balance most often causes overweight and obesity. Energy balance means that your energy IN equals your energy OUT.\n                \nEnergy IN is the amount of energy or calories you get from food and drinks. Energy OUT is the amount of energy your body uses for things like breathing, digesting, and being physically active.\n                \nTo maintain a healthy weight, your energy IN and OUT don't have to balance exactly every day. It's the balance over time that helps you maintain a healthy weight.\n                \nThe same amount of energy IN and energy OUT over time = weight stays the same\n                \nMore energy IN than energy OUT over time = weight gain\n                \nMore energy OUT than energy IN over time = weight loss\n                \nOverweight and obesity happen over time when you take in more calories than you use.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nAn Inactive Lifestyle\n                \nMany Americans aren't very physically active. One reason for this is that many people spend hours in front of TVs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. In fact, more than 2 hours a day of regular TV viewing time has been linked to overweight and obesity.\n                \nOther reasons for not being active include: relying on cars instead of walking, fewer physical demands at work or at home because of modern technology and conveniences, and lack of physical education classes in schools.\n                \nPeople who are inactive are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn the calories that they take in from food and drinks. An inactive lifestyle also raises your risk for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer, and other health problems.\n                \nEnvironment\n                \nOur environment doesn't support healthy lifestyle habits; in fact, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include:\n                \nLack of neighborhood sidewalks and safe places for recreation. Not having area parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active.\n                \nWork schedules. People often say that they don't have time to be physically active because of long work hours and time spent commuting.\n                \nOversized food portions. Americans are exposed to huge food portions in restaurants, fast food places, gas stations, movie theaters, supermarkets, and even at home. Some of these meals and snacks can feed two or more people. Eating large portions means too much energy IN. Over time, this will cause weight gain if it isn't balanced with physical activity.\n                \nLack of access to healthy foods. Some people don't live in neighborhoods that have supermarkets that sell healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Or, for some people, these healthy foods are too costly.\n                \nFood advertising. Americans are surrounded by ads from food companies. Often children are the targets of advertising for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks. The goal of these ads is to sway people to buy these high-calorie foods, and often they do.\n                \nGenes and Family History\n                \nStudies of identical twins who have been raised apart show that genes have a strong influence on a person's weight. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. Your chances of being overweight are greater if one or both of your parents are overweight or obese.\n                \nYour genes also may affect the amount of fat you store in your body and where on your body you carry the extra fat. Because families also share food and physical activity habits, a link exists between genes and the environment.\n                \nChildren adopt the habits of their parents. A child who has overweight parents who eat high-calorie foods and are inactive will likely become overweight too. However, if the family adopts healthy food and physical activity habits, the child's chance of being overweight or obese is reduced.\n                \nHealth Conditions\n                \nSome hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), Cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n                \nUnderactive thyroid is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. Lack of thyroid hormone will slow down your metabolism and cause weight gain. You'll also feel tired and weak.\n                \nCushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body's adrenal glands make too much of the hormone cortisol. Cushing's syndrome also can develop if a person takes high doses of certain medicines, such as prednisone, for long periods.\n                \nPeople who have Cushing's syndrome gain weight, have upper-body obesity, a rounded face, fat around the neck, and thin arms and legs.\n                \nPCOS is a condition that affects about 510 percent of women of childbearing age. Women who have PCOS often are obese, have excess hair growth, and have reproductive problems and other health issues. These problems are caused by high levels of hormones called androgens.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nCertain medicines may cause you to gain weight. These medicines include some corticosteroids, antidepressants, and seizure medicines.\n                \nThese medicines can slow the rate at which your body burns calories, increase your appetite, or cause your body to hold on to extra water. All of these factors can lead to weight gain.\n                \nEmotional Factors\n                \nSome people eat more than usual when they're bored, angry, or stressed. Over time, overeating will lead to weight gain and may cause overweight or obesity.\n                \nSmoking\n                \nSome people gain weight when they stop smoking. One reason is that food often tastes and smells better after quitting smoking.\n                \nAnother reason is because nicotine raises the rate at which your body burns calories, so you burn fewer calories when you stop smoking. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.\n                \nAge\n                \nAs you get older, you tend to lose muscle, especially if you're less active. Muscle loss can slow down the rate at which your body burns calories. If you don't reduce your calorie intake as you get older, you may gain weight.\n                \nMidlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but menopause also plays a role. Many women gain about 5 pounds during menopause and have more fat around the waist than they did before.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nDuring pregnancy, women gain weight to support their babies growth and development. After giving birth, some women find it hard to lose the weight. This may lead to overweight or obesity, especially after a few pregnancies.\n                \nLack of Sleep\n                \nResearch shows that lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity. For example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. Lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well.\n                \nPeople who sleep fewer hours also seem to prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates, which can lead to overeating, weight gain, and obesity.\n                \nSleep helps maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin). When you don't get enough sleep, your level of ghrelin goes up and your level of leptin goes down. This makes you feel hungrier than when you're well-rested.\n                \nSleep also affects how your body reacts to insulin, the hormone that controls your blood glucose (sugar) level. Lack of sleep results in a higher than normal blood sugar level, which may increase your risk for diabetes.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency article."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Overweight and Obesity? ?",
            "answer": "Being overweight or obese isn't a cosmetic problem. These conditions greatly raise your risk for other health problems.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Adults\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nAs your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nPlaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. This can cause angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)\n                \nObesity also can lead to heart failure. This is a serious condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\n                \nYour chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you're overweight or obese.\n                \nStroke\n                \nBeing overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form.\n                \nIf the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. The risk of having a stroke rises as BMI increases.\n                \nType 2 Diabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nIn type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly. At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, however, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\n                \nDiabetes is a leading cause of early death, CHD, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\n                \nAbnormal Blood Fats\n                \nIf you're overweight or obese, you're at increased risk of having abnormal levels of blood fats. These include high levels of triglycerides and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol.\n                \nAbnormal levels of these blood fats are a risk factor for CHD. For more information about triglycerides and LDL and HDL cholesterol, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nYou can develop any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:\n                \nA large waistline. This is called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\n                \nA higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).\n                \nA lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).\n                \nHigher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nHigher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes).\n                \nCancer\n                \nBeing overweight or obese raises your risk for colon, breast, endometrial, and gallbladder cancers.\n                \nOsteoarthritis\n                \nOsteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition occurs if the tissue that protects the joints wears away. Extra weight can put more pressure and wear on joints, causing pain.\n                \nSleep Apnea\n                \nSleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nA person who has sleep apnea may have more fat stored around the neck. This can narrow the airway, making it hard to breathe.\n                \nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome\n                \nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).\n                \nOHS can lead to serious health problems and may even cause death.\n                \nReproductive Problems\n                \nObesity can cause menstrual issues and infertility in women.\n                \nGallstones\n                \nGallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in the gallbladder. They're mostly made of cholesterol. Gallstones can cause stomach or back pain.\n                \nPeople who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of having gallstones. Also, being overweight may result in an enlarged gallbladder that doesn't work well.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Children and Teens\n                \nOverweight and obesity also increase the health risks for children and teens. Type2 diabetes once was rare in American children, but an increasing number of children are developing the disease.\n                \nAlso, overweight children are more likely to become overweight or obese as adults, with the same disease risks."

This serious health problem has been growing over the last 30 years.\n                \nAdults\n                \nAccording to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20092010, almost 70 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. The survey also shows differences in overweight and obesity among racial/ethnic groups.\n                \nIn women, overweight and obesity are highest among non-Hispanic Black women (about 82percent), compared with about 76 percent for Hispanic women and 64 percent for non-Hispanic White women.\n                \nIn men, overweight and obesity are highest among Hispanic men (about 82percent), compared with about 74 percent for non-Hispanic White men and about 70 percent for non-Hispanic Black men.\n                \nChildren and Teens\n                \nChildren also have become heavier. In the past 30 years, obesity has tripled among school-aged children and teens.\n                \nAccording to NHANES 20092010, about 1 in 6 American children ages 219 are obese. The survey also suggests that overweight and obesity are having a greater effect on minority groups, including Blacks and Hispanics."

            "question": "How to diagnose Overweight and Obesity ?",
            "answer": "The most common way to find out whether you're overweight or obese is to figure out your body mass index (BMI). BMI is an estimate of body fat, and it's a good gauge of your risk for diseases that occur with more body fat.\n                \nBMI is calculated from your height and weight. You can use the chart below or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI. Or, you health care provider can measure your BMI.\n                \nBody Mass Index for Adults\n                \nUse this table to learn your BMI. First, find your height on the far left column. Next, move across the row to find your weight. Weight is measured with underwear but no shoes.\n                \nOnce you've found your weight, move to the very top of that column. This number is your BMI.\n                \nThis table offers a sample of BMI measurements. If you don't see your height and/or weight listed on this table, go the NHLBI's complete Body Mass Index Table.\n                \nWhat Does Body Mass Index Mean? \n                \nAlthough BMI can be used for most men and women, it does have some limits. It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build. BMI also may underestimate body fat in older people and others who have lost muscle.\n                \nBody Mass Index for Children and Teens\n                \nOverweight are obesity are defined differently for children and teens than for adults. Children are still growing, and boys and girls mature at different rates.\n                \nBMIs for children and teens compare their heights and weights against growth charts that take age and sex into account. This is called BMI-for-age percentile. A child or teen's BMI-for-age percentile shows how his or her BMI compares with other boys and girls of the same age.\n                \nFor more information about BMI-for-age and growth charts for children, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's BMI-for-age calculator.\n                \nWhat Does the BMI-for-Age Percentile Mean?\n                \nWaist Circumference\n                \nHealth care professionals also may take your waist measurement. This helps screen for the possible health risks related to overweight and obesity in adults.\n                \nIf you have abdominal obesity and most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, you're at increased risk for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The risk goes up with a waist size that's greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40inches for men.\n                \nYou also can measure your waist size. To do so correctly, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nA primary care doctor (or pediatrician for children and teens) will assess your BMI, waist measurement, and overall health risk. If you're overweight or obese, or if you have a large waist size, your doctor should explain the health risks and find out whether you're interested and willing to lose weight.\n                \nIf you are, you and your doctor can work together to create a treatment plan. The plan may include weight-loss goals and treatment options that are realistic for you.\n                \nYour doctor may send you to other health care specialists if you need expert care. These specialists may include:\n                \nAn endocrinologist if you need to be treated for type 2 diabetes or a hormone problem, such as an underactive thyroid.\n                \nA registered dietitian or nutritionist to work with you on ways to change your eating habits.\n                \nAn exercise physiologist or trainer to figure out your level of fitness and show you how to do physical activities suitable for you.\n                \nA bariatric surgeon if weight-loss surgery is an option for you.\n                \nA psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker to help treat depression or stress."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Overweight and Obesity ?",
            "answer": "Successful weight-loss treatments include setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. Medicines and weight-loss surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren't enough.\n                \nSet Realistic Goals\n                \nSetting realistic weight-loss goals is an important first step to losing weight.\n                \nFor Adults\n                \nTry to lose 5 to 10 percent of your current weight over 6 months. This will lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other conditions.\n                \nThe best way to lose weight is slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is do-able, safe, and will help you keep off the weight. It also will give you the time to make new, healthy lifestyle changes.\n                \nIf you've lost 10 percent of your body weight, have kept it off for 6 months, and are still overweight or obese, you may want to consider further weight loss.\n                \nFor Children and Teens\n                \nIf your child is overweight or at risk for overweight or obesity, the goal is to maintain his or her current weight and to focus on eating healthy and being physically active. This should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes.\n                \nIf your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. Example of lifestyle changes include:\n                \nFocusing on balancing energy IN (calories from food and drinks) with energy OUT (physical activity)\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan\n                \nLearning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits\n                \nOver time, these changes will become part of your everyday life.\n                \nCalories\n                \nCutting back on calories (energy IN) will help you lose weight. To lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day.\n                \nIn general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely.\n                \nIn general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. This calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely.\n                \nThese calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. If you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. If you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day.\n                \nVery low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you.\n                \nFor overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain. However, reduced-calorie diets aren't advised unless you talk with a health care provider.\n                \nHealthy Eating Plan\n                \nA healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. It has enough calories for good health, but not so many that you gain weight.\n                \nA healthy eating plan is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions.\n                \nHealthy foods include:\n                \nFat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk.\n                \nProtein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas.\n                \nWhole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. Other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers.\n                \nFruits, which can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.\n                \nVegetables, which can be fresh, canned (without salt), frozen, or dried.\n                \nCanola and olive oils, and soft margarines made from these oils, are heart healthy. However, you should use them in small amounts because they're high in calories.\n                \nYou also can include unsalted nuts, like walnuts and almonds, in your diet as long as you limit the amount you eat (nuts also are high in calories).\n                \nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Aim for a Healthy Weight\" patient booklet provides more information about following a healthy eating plan.\n                \nFoods to limit. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and also might be high in calories. Fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited.\n                \nSaturated fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats)\n                \nPoultry with the skin\n                \nHigh-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream\n                \nLard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods\n                \nTrans fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFoods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening\n                \nBaked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads\n                \nFoods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken\n                \nCholesterol mainly is found in:\n                \nEgg yolks\n                \nOrgan meats, such as liver\n                \nShrimp\n                \nWhole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese\n                \nLimiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks.\n                \nCheck the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. Drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake.\n                \nPortion size. A portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. It's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the Nutrition Facts label on food packages.\n                \nAnyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. In fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. These growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion.\n                \nCutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy IN.\n                \nFood weight. Studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant \"weight\" of food. Ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. Knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food.\n                \nFor example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nBeing physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. Physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. It will:\n                \nLower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers)\n                \nStrengthen your heart and help your lungs work better\n                \nStrengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition\n                \nSlow bone loss\n                \nGive you more energy\n                \nHelp you relax and better cope with stress\n                \nAllow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly\n                \nGive you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family\n                \nThe four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. You can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. The level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity.\n                \nPeople vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. Many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\n                \nPeople who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. This also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost.\n                \nYou don't have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nIf you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. You also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness.\n                \nChildren should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development.\n                \nMany people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. When starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury.\n                \nIf you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time.\n                \nWhen starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity.\n                \nTo lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.\n                \nA daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. Use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. Try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics.\n                \nFor greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. For example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the Department of Health and Human Services \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\" and the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article.\n                \nBehavioral Changes\n                \nChanging your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. The first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. The next step is to change these habits.\n                \nBelow are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits.\n                \nChange your surroundings. You might be more likely to overeat when watching TV, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. You also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. However, you can change these habits.\n                \nInstead of watching TV, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk.\n                \nLeave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee.\n                \nBring a change of clothes to work. Head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work.\n                \nPut a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class.\n                \nKeep a record. A record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. You also can keep track of your weight. For example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. A record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.\n                \nSeek support. Ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. You can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. You also can join a support group.\n                \nReward success. Reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. Choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music CD, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time.\n                \nWeight-Loss Medicines\n                \nWeight-loss medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might be an option for some people.\n                \nIf you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. You should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n                \nWeight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a BMI of 30 or greater). People who have BMIs of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines.\n                \nSibutramine (Meridia)\n                \nAs of October 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (Meridia) was taken off the market in the United States. Research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \n                \nOrlistat (Xenical and Alli)\n                \nOrlistat (Xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. Most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine.\n                \nPeople taking Xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. During checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. He or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions.\n                \nThe FDA also has approved Alli, an over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss aid for adults. Alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. Alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. In studies, most people taking Alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months.\n                \nBoth Xenical and Alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss. Both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools.\n                \nAlthough rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. More research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. Talk with your doctor if youre considering using Xenical or Alli to lose weight. He or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you.\n                \nYou also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. Also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins.\n                \nLorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia\n                \nIn July 2012, the FDA approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. Lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia are approved for adults who have a BMI of 30 or greater. (Qsymia is a combination of two FDA-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.)\n                \nThese medicines also are approved for adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol.\n                \nBoth medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity.\n                \nOther Medicines\n                \nSome prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't FDA-approved for treating obesity. They include:\n                \nMedicines to treat depression. Some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine.\n                \nMedicines to treat seizures. Two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. These medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity.\n                \nMedicines to treat diabetes. Metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. It's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake.\n                \nOver-the-Counter Products\n                \nSome OTC products claim to promote weight loss. The FDA doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines.\n                \nHowever, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. Some of these OTC products include:\n                \nEphedra (also called ma huang). Ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. The active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. Ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. It causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the United States.\n                \nChromium. This is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. While studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it.\n                \nDiuretics and herbal laxatives. These products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. They also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems.\n                \nHoodia. Hoodia is a cactus that's native to Africa. It's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. However, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. No large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe.\n                \nWeight-Loss Surgery\n                \nWeight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a BMI of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as:\n                \nSevere sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep)\n                \nObesity-related cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle)\n                \nSevere type 2 diabetes\n                \nTypes of Weight-Loss Surgery\n                \nTwo common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. For gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold.\n                \nFor gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. This surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. However, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. Gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically.\n                \nGastric bypass has more side effects. They include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. These side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. After gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies.\n                \nLifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. Your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills.\n                \nIf you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. Ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect.\n                \nWeight-Loss Maintenance\n                \nMaintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. For adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. You also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight).\n                \nAfter 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if:\n                \nYou've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight\n                \nYou're still overweight or obese\n                \nThe key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. Adopt these changes as a new way of life.\n                \nIf you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. For example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. It's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine."

            "answer": "Following a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent overweight and obesity. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. Thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active.\n                \nMake following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. For example:\n                \nFollow a healthy eating plan. Make healthy food choices, keep your calorie needs and your family's calorie needs in mind, and focus on the balance of energy IN and energy OUT.\n                \nFocus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion size will help you balance energy IN and energy OUT.\n                \nBe active. Make personal and family time active. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run.\n                \nReduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames because they limit time for physical activity. Health experts recommend 2hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related.\n                \nKeep track of your weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Also, keep track of your children's growth.\n                \nLed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, four Institutes from the National Institutes of Health have come together to promote We Can!Ways to Enhance Children's Activity & Nutrition.\n                \nWe Can! is a national education program designed for parents and caregivers to help children 8 to 13 years old maintain a healthy weight. The evidence-based program offers parents and families tips and fun activities to encourage healthy eating, increase physical activity, and reduce time spent being inactive.\n                \nCurrently, more than 140 community groups around the country are participating in We Can! programs for parents and youth. These community groups include hospitals, health departments, clinics, faith-based organizations, YMCAs, schools, and more.\n                \n____________\n                \nWe Can! is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."

            "question": "What is (are) Hemophilia ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nHemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally.\n                \nIf you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nPeople born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot.\n                \nPlatelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding.\n                \nThe two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9).\n                \nRarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working.\n                \nThis article focuses on inherited hemophilia.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nHemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder.\n                \nPeople who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than 1 percent.\n                \nHemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year."
        },
        {
            "question": "What causes Hemophilia ?",
            "answer": "A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz).\n                \nChromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors.\n                \nA male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding.\n                \nVery rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females.\n                \nSome males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child.\n                \nBelow are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited.\n                \nInheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 1\n                \n\n                \nEach daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia.\n                \nInheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 2\n                \n\n                \nEach daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Hemophilia ?",
            "answer": "The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising.\n                \nExcessive Bleeding\n                \nThe extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is.\n                \nChildren who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision.\n                \nBleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding).\n                \nSigns of external bleeding may include:\n                \nBleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth\n                \nNosebleeds for no obvious reason\n                \nHeavy bleeding from a minor cut\n                \nBleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time\n                \nSigns of internal bleeding may include:\n                \nBlood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder)\n                \nBlood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach)\n                \nLarge bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body)\n                \nBleeding in the Joints\n                \nBleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury.\n                \nAt first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend.\n                \nSwelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint.\n                \nBleeding in the Brain\n                \nInternal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include:\n                \nLong-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness\n                \nRepeated vomiting\n                \nSleepiness or changes in behavior\n                \nSudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking\n                \nDouble vision\n                \nConvulsions or seizures"

            "question": "How to diagnose Hemophilia ?",
            "answer": "If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease.\n                \nYou or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out:\n                \nHow long it takes for your blood to clot\n                \nWhether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors\n                \nWhether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood\n                \nThe test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is.\n                \nHemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood.\n                \nThe severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia.\n                \nSevere hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults.\n                \nThe bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different.\n                \nPregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies.\n                \nWomen who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia.\n                \nFor this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Hemophilia ?",
            "answer": "Treatment With Replacement Therapy\n                \nThe main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low.\n                \nClotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small.\n                \nTo further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at homeit only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor.\n                \nYou may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy.\n                \nDemand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy.\n                \nComplications of Replacement Therapy\n                \nComplications of replacement therapy include:\n                \nDeveloping antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor\n                \nDeveloping viral infections from human clotting factors\n                \nDamage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment\n                \nAntibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working.\n                \nThese antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 2030 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 25 percent of people who have hemophilia B.\n                \nWhen antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away.\n                \nResearchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors.\n                \nViruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to:\n                \nCareful screening of blood donors\n                \nTesting of donated blood products\n                \nTreating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses\n                \nVaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B\n                \nDamage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \n                \nBleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function.\n                \nSwelling of the membrane around a joint.\n                \nPain, swelling, and redness of a joint.\n                \nPressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint.\n                \nHome Treatment With Replacement Therapy\n                \nYou can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages:\n                \nYou or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications.\n                \nFewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed.\n                \nHome treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting.\n                \nHome treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health.\n                \nDiscuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia).\n                \nDoctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child.\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nDesmopressin\n                \nDesmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A.\n                \nDDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer.\n                \nDDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding.\n                \nAntifibrinolytic Medicines\n                \nAntifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down.\n                \nThese medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding.\n                \nGene Therapy\n                \nResearchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials.\n                \nFor more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article.\n                \nTreatment of a Specific Bleeding Site\n                \nPain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take.\n                \nWhich Treatment Is Best for You?\n                \nThe type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having.\n                \nMild hemophiliaReplacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII.\n                \nModerate hemophiliaYou may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding.\n                \nSevere hemophiliaYou usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life.\n                \nFor both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding.\n                \nOther family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment."

            "answer": "Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects can involve:\n                \nThe interior walls of the heart\n                \nThe valves inside the heart\n                \nThe arteries and veins that carry blood to the heart or the body\n                \nCongenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nThere are many types of congenital heart defects. They range from simple defects with no symptoms to complex defects with severe, life-threatening symptoms.\n                \nCongenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. They affect 8 out of every 1,000 newborns. Each year, more than 35,000 babies in the United States are born with congenital heart defects.\n                \nMany of these defects are simple conditions. They need no treatment or are easily fixed. Some babies are born with complex congenital heart defects. These defects require special medical care soon after birth.\n                \nThe diagnosis and treatment of complex heart defects has greatly improved over the past few decades. As a result, almost all children who have complex heart defects survive to adulthood and can live active, productive lives.\n                \nMost people who have complex heart defects continue to need special heart care throughout their lives. They may need to pay special attention to how their condition affects issues such as health insurance, employment, birth control and pregnancy, and other health issues.\n                \nIn the United States, more than 1 million adults are living with congenital heart defects."

However, doctors often don't know why congenital heart defects occur.\n                \nHeredity may play a role in some heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the defect. Rarely, more than one child in a family is born with a heart defect.\n                \nChildren who have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, often have congenital heart defects. In fact, half of all babies who have Down syndrome have congenital heart defects.\n                \nSmoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects.\n                \nResearchers continue to search for the causes of congenital heart defects."

A doctor may not even detect signs of a heart defect during a physical exam.\n                \nSome heart defects do cause signs and symptoms. They depend on the number, type, and severity of the defects. Severe defects can cause signs and symptoms, usually in newborns. These signs and symptoms may include:\n                \nRapid breathing\n                \nCyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails)\n                \nFatigue (tiredness)\n                \nPoor blood circulation\n                \nCongenital heart defects don't cause chest pain or other painful symptoms.\n                \nHeart defects can cause heart murmurs (extra or unusual sounds heard during a heartbeat). Doctors can hear heart murmurs using a stethoscope. However, not all murmurs are signs of congenital heart defects. Many healthy children have heart murmurs.\n                \nNormal growth and development depend on a normal workload for the heart and normal flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body. Babies who have congenital heart defects may have cyanosis and tire easily while feeding. As a result, they may not gain weight or grow as they should.\n                \nOlder children who have congenital heart defects may get tired easily or short of breath during physical activity.\n                \nMany types of congenital heart defects cause the heart to work harder than it should. With severe defects, this can lead to heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Symptoms of heart failure include:\n                \nShortness of breath or trouble breathing\n                \nFatigue with physical activity\n                \nA buildup of blood and fluid in the lungs\n                \nSwelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck"

            "question": "How to diagnose Congenital Heart Defects ?",
            "answer": "Severe congenital heart defects generally are diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth. Less severe defects often aren't diagnosed until children are older.\n                \nMinor defects often have no signs or symptoms. Doctors may diagnose them based on results from a physical exam and tests done for another reason.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPediatric cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the care of babies and children who have heart problems. Cardiac surgeons are specialists who repair heart defects using surgery.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring a physical exam, the doctor will:\n                \nListen to your child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope\n                \nLook for signs of a heart defect, such as cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, delayed growth, or signs of heart failure\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. During the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.\n                \nEcho allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.\n                \nEcho is an important test for both diagnosing a heart problem and following the problem over time. The test can show problems with the heart's structure and how the heart is reacting to those problems. Echo will help your child's cardiologist decide if and when treatment is needed.\n                \nDuring pregnancy, if your doctor suspects that your baby has a congenital heart defect, fetal echo can be done. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the baby's heart while the baby is still in the womb.\n                \nFetal echo usually is done at about 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. If your child is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect before birth, your doctor can plan treatment before the baby is born.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can detect if one of the heart's chambers is enlarged, which can help diagnose a heart problem.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether the heart is enlarged. It also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.\n                \nPulse Oximetry\n                \nFor this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). The sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart.\n                \nSpecial dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the hearts chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see blood flowing through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.\n                \nThe doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart.\n                \nCardiac catheterization also is used to repair some heart defects."

Other factors include your child's age, size, and general health.\n                \nSome children who have complex congenital heart defects may need several catheter or surgical procedures over a period of years, or they may need to take medicines for years.\n                \nCatheter Procedures\n                \nCatheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery. They involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein or an artery.\n                \nDoctors don't have to surgically open the chest or operate directly on the heart to repair the defect(s). This means that recovery may be easier and quicker.\n                \nThe use of catheter procedures has increased a lot in the past 20 years. They have become the preferred way to repair many simple heart defects, such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary valve stenosis.\n                \nFor ASD repair, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein in the groin (upper thigh). He or she threads the tube to the heart's septum. A device made up of two small disks or an umbrella-like device is attached to the catheter.\n                \nWhen the catheter reaches the septum, the device is pushed out of the catheter. The device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria. Its secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body.\n                \nWithin 6 months, normal tissue grows in and over the device. The closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows.\n                \nFor pulmonary valve stenosis, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein and threads it to the hearts pulmonary valve. A tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is quickly inflated to push apart the leaflets, or \"doors,\" of the valve.\n                \nThen, the balloon is deflated and the catheter and ballon are withdrawn. This procedure can be used to repair any narrowed valve in the heart.\n                \nTo help guide the catheter, doctors often use echocardiography (echo), transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE), and coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee).\n                \nTEE is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach. Doctors also use TEE to examine complex heart defects.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nA child may need open-heart surgery if his or her heart defect can't be fixed using a catheter procedure. Sometimes one surgery can repair the defect completely. If that's not possible, the child may need more surgeries over months or years to fix the problem.\n                \nCardiac surgeons may use open-heart surgery to:\n                \nClose holes in the heart with stitches or a patch\n                \nRepair or replace heart valves\n                \nWiden arteries or openings to heart valves\n                \nRepair complex defects, such as problems with the location of blood vessels near the heart or how they are formed\n                \nRarely, babies are born with multiple defects that are too complex to repair. These babies may need heart transplants. In this procedure, the child's heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased child. The heart has been donated by the deceased childs family."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nAtherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body.\n                \nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.\n                \nAtherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death.\n                \nAtherosclerosis\n                \n\n                \nAtherosclerosis-Related Diseases\n                \nAtherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys.

These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nIf blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, you may have angina (chest pain or discomfort) or a heart attack.\n                \nPlaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't cause blockages in the arteries as it does in CHD.\n                \nCarotid Artery Disease\n                \nCarotid (ka-ROT-id) artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck (the carotid arteries).

These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys.\n                \nOver time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe cause of atherosclerosis isn't known.

Others you can't control, such as age and a family history of heart disease.\n                \nSome people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms. They may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nThe main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes. You also may need medicines and medical procedures. These treatments, along with ongoing medical care, can help you live a healthier life.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nImproved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases.

These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open).\n                \nWhen this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots. Clots narrow the arteries even more, limiting the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.\n                \nDepending on which arteries are affected, blood clots can worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nResearchers continue to look for the causes of atherosclerosis. They hope to find answers to questions such as:\n                \nWhy and how do the arteries become damaged?\n                \nHow does plaque develop and change over time?\n                \nWhy does plaque rupture and lead to blood clots?"

            "question": "Who is at risk for Atherosclerosis? ?",
            "answer": "The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you'll develop atherosclerosis.\n                \nYou can control most risk factors and help prevent or delay atherosclerosis. Other risk factors can't be controlled.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol).\n                \nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn't allow enough oxygen to reach the body's tissues.\n                \nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.\n                \nDiabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\n                \nOverweight or obesity. The terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nLack of physical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors.\n                \nOlder age. As you get older, your risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55.\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.\n                \nAlthough age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn't mean that you'll develop atherosclerosis if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent atherosclerosis, even in older adults.\n                \nStudies show that an increasing number of children and youth are at risk for atherosclerosis. This is due to a number of causes, including rising childhood obesity rates.\n                \nEmerging Risk Factors\n                \nScientists continue to study other possible risk factors for atherosclerosis.\n                \nHigh levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk for atherosclerosis and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body.\n                \nInflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.\n                \nPeople who have low CRP levels may develop atherosclerosis at a slower rate than people who have high CRP levels. Research is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk for atherosclerosis.\n                \nHigh levels of triglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides) in the blood also may raise the risk for atherosclerosis, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat.\n                \nStudies are under way to find out whether genetics may play a role in atherosclerosis risk.\n                \nOther Factors That Affect Atherosclerosis\n                \nOther factors also may raise your risk for atherosclerosis, such as:\n                \nSleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nStress. Research shows that the most commonly reported \"trigger\" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger.\n                \nAlcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Atherosclerosis ?",
            "answer": "Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nSome people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected.\n                \nCoronary Arteries\n                \nThe coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called coronary heart disease, or CHD), a common symptom is angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\n                \nOther symptoms of CHD are shortness of breath and arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nPlaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Symptoms of coronary MVD include angina, shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.\n                \nCarotid Arteries\n                \nThe carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called carotid artery disease), you may have symptoms of a stroke. These symptoms may include:\n                \nSudden weakness\n                \nParalysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body\n                \nConfusion\n                \nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\n                \nTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\n                \nProblems breathing\n                \nDizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls\n                \nLoss of consciousness\n                \nSudden and severe headache\n                \nPeripheral Arteries\n                \nPlaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease calledperipheral artery disease).\n                \nIf these major arteries are narrowed or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections.\n                \nRenal Arteries\n                \nThe renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, you may develop chronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.\n                \nEarly kidney disease often has no signs or symptoms. As the disease gets worse it can cause tiredness, changes in how you urinate (more often or less often), loss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), swelling in the hands or feet, itchiness or numbness, and trouble concentrating."

            "question": "How to diagnose Atherosclerosis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose atherosclerosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you have atherosclerosis, a primary care doctor, such as an internist or family practitioner, may handle your care. Your doctor may recommend other health care specialists if you need expert care, such as:\n                \nA cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. You may go to a cardiologist if you haveperipheral artery disease(P.A.D.)or coronary microvascular disease (MVD).\n                \nA vascular specialist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood vessel problems. You may go to a vascular specialist if you have P.A.D.\n                \nA neurologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating nervous system disorders. You may see a neurologist if you've had a stroke due to carotid artery disease.\n                \nA nephrologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating kidney diseases and conditions. You may go to a nephrologist if you have chronic kidney disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor may listen to your arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E). Your doctor can hear a bruit when placing a stethoscope over an affected artery. A bruit may indicate poor blood flow due to plaque buildup.\n                \nYour doctor also may check to see whether any of your pulses (for example, in the leg or foot) are weak or absent. A weak or absent pulse can be a sign of a blocked artery.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more tests to diagnose atherosclerosis. These tests also can help your doctor learn the extent of your disease and plan the best treatment.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for atherosclerosis.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage caused by CHD. The test also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure.\n                \nAnkle/Brachial Index\n                \nThis test compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm to see how well your blood is flowing. This test can help diagnose P.A.D.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nComputed Tomography Scan\n                \nA computed tomography (CT) scan creates computer-generated pictures of the heart, brain, or other areas of the body. The test can show hardening and narrowing of large arteries.\n                \nA cardiac CT scan also can show whether calcium has built up in the walls of the coronary (heart) arteries. This may be an early sign of CHD.\n                \nStress Testing\n                \nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nWhen your heart is working hard, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\n                \nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\n                \nShortness of breath or chest pain\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\n                \nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. They also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nAngiography\n                \nAngiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your arteries. This test can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is.\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. Dye that can be seen on an x-ray picture is injected through the catheter into the arteries. By looking at the x-ray picture, your doctor can see the flow of blood through your arteries.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests are being studied to see whether they can give a better view of plaque buildup in the arteries. Examples of these tests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Atherosclerosis ?",
            "answer": "Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:\n                \nLowering the risk of blood clots forming\n                \nPreventing atherosclerosis-related diseases\n                \nReducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque\n                \nRelieving symptoms\n                \nWidening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nA BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nCoronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nLower your blood pressure\n                \nLower your blood sugar levels\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke\n                \nPrevent inflammation\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nIf you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.\n                \nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nBypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.\n                \nCarotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke."

            "question": "What is (are) Heart Failure ?",
            "answer": "Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In some cases, the heart can't fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can't pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.\n                \nThe term \"heart failure\" doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart failure develops over time as the heart's pumping action grows weaker. The condition can affect the right side of the heart only, or it can affect both sides of the heart. Most cases involve both sides of the heart.\n                \nRight-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\n                \nRight-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness).\n                \nThe leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nHeart failure is a very common condition. About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure.Both children and adults can have the condition, although the symptoms and treatments differ. The Health Topicfocuses on heart failure in adults.\n                \nCurrently, heart failure has no cure. However, treatmentssuch as medicines and lifestyle changescan help people who have the condition live longer and more active lives. Researchers continue to study new ways to treat heart failure and its complications."

            "question": "What causes Heart Failure ?",
            "answer": "Conditions that damage or overwork the heart muscle can cause heart failure. Over time, the heart weakens. It isnt able to fill with and/or pump blood as well as it should. As the heart weakens, certain proteins and substances might be released into the blood. These substances have a toxic effect on the heart and blood flow, and they worsen heart failure.\n                \nCauses of heart failure include:\n                \nCoronary heart disease\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nOther heart conditions or diseases\n                \nOther factors\n                \n\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nCoronary heart disease is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. Coronary heart disease can lead to chest pain or discomfort calledangina, aheart attack, and heart damage.\n                \n\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the bodys blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. The body normally breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nIn diabetes, the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage and weaken the heart muscle and the blood vessels around the heart, leading to heart failure.\n                \n\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup.\n                \nBlood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.\n                \n\n                \nOther Heart Conditions or Diseases\n                \nOther conditions and diseases also can lead to heart failure, such as:\n                \nArrhythmia. Happens when a problem occurs with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nCardiomyopathy.Happens when the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid.\n                \nCongenital heart defects. Problems with the hearts structure are present at birth.\n                \nHeart valve disease. Occurs if one or more of your heart valves doesnt work properly, which can be present at birth or caused by infection, other heart conditions, and age.\n                \n\n                \nOther Factors\n                \nOther factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. Examples include:\n                \nAlcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use\n                \nHIV/AIDS\n                \nThyroid disorders (having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)\n                \nToo much vitamin E\n                \nTreatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy"

The number of people who have this condition is growing.\n                \nHeart failure is more common in:\n                \nPeople who are age 65 or older. Aging can weaken the heart muscle. Older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital stays among people on Medicare.\n                \nBlacks are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. Theyre also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age, have more hospital visits due to heart failure, and die from heart failure.\n                \nPeople who areoverweight. Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure.\n                \nPeople who have had a heart attack. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack and can weaken the heart muscle.\n                \nChildren who havecongenital heart defectsalso can develop heart failure. These defects occur if the heart, heart valves, or blood vessels near the heart dont form correctly while a baby is in the womb. Congenital heart defects can make the heart work harder. This weakens the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure. Children dont have the same symptoms of heart failure or get the same treatments as adults.

The signs and symptoms of heart failure also are common in other conditions. Thus, your doctor will:\n                \nFind out whether you have a disease or condition that can cause heart failure, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, or diabetes\n                \nRule out other causes of your symptoms\n                \nFind any damage to your heart and check how well your heart pumps blood\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will ask whether you or others in your family have or have had a disease or condition that can cause heart failure.\n                \nYour doctor also will ask about your symptoms. He or she will want to know which symptoms you have, when they occur, how long you've had them, and how severe they are. Your answers will help show whether and how much your symptoms limit your daily routine.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will:\n                \nListen to your heart for sounds that aren't normal\n                \nListen to your lungs for the sounds of extra fluid buildup\n                \nLook for swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and the veins in your neck\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nNo single test can diagnose heart failure. If you have signs and symptoms of heart failure, your doctor may recommend one or more tests.\n                \nYour doctor also may refer you to a cardiologist. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nAn EKG may show whether the walls in your heart's pumping chambers are thicker than normal. Thicker walls can make it harder for your heart to pump blood. An EKG also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x raytakes pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged, you have fluid in your lungs, or you have lung disease.\n                \nBNP Blood Test\n                \nThis test checks the level of a hormone in your blood called BNP. The level of this hormone rises during heart failure.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves work.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and heart muscle damage caused by lack of blood flow.\n                \nEcho might be done before and after a stress test (see below). A stress echo can show how well blood is flowing through your heart. The test also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nDoppler Ultrasound\n                \nA Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure the speed and direction of blood flow. This test often is done with echo to give a more complete picture of blood flow to the heart and lungs.\n                \nDoctors often use Doppler ultrasound to help diagnose right-side heart failure.\n                \nHolter Monitor\n                \nA Holter monitor records your heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period, while you go about your normal daily routine.\n                \nYou wear small patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.\n                \nNuclear Heart Scan\n                \nA nuclear heart scan shows how well blood is flowing through your heart and how much blood is reaching your heart muscle.\n                \nDuring a nuclear heart scan, a safe, radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into your bloodstream through a vein. The tracer travels to your heart and releases energy. Special cameras outside of your body detect the energy and use it to create pictures of your heart.\n                \nA nuclear heart scan can show where the heart muscle is healthy and where it's damaged.\n                \nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a type of nuclear heart scan. It shows the level of chemical activity in areas of your heart. This test can help your doctor see whether enough blood is flowing to these areas. A PET scan can show blood flow problems that other tests might not detect.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. This allows your doctor to look inside your coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nDuring this procedure, your doctor can check the pressure and blood flow in your heart chambers, collect blood samples, and use x rays to look at your coronary arteries.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) usually is done with cardiac catheterization. A dye that can be seen on x ray is injected into your bloodstream through the tip of the catheter.\n                \nThe dye allows your doctor to see the flow of blood to your heart muscle. Angiography also shows how well your heart is pumping.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nYou may walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nHeart tests, such as nuclear heart scanning and echo, often are done during stress testing.\n                \nCardiac MRI\n                \nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it's beating. The test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\n                \nA cardiac MRI can show whether parts of your heart are damaged. Doctors also have used MRI in research studies to find early signs of heart failure, even before symptoms appear.\n                \nThyroid Function Tests\n                \nThyroid function tests show how well your thyroid gland is working. These tests include blood tests, imaging tests, and tests to stimulate the thyroid. Having too much or too little thyroid hormone in the blood can lead to heart failure."

Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nLiquid Intake\n                \nIts important for people who have heart failure to take in the correct amounts and types of liquids. Consuming too much liquid can worsen heart failure. Also, if you have heart failure, you shouldnt drink alcohol. Talk with your doctor about what amounts and types of liquids you should have each day.\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart failure and coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen heart failure. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor will prescribe medicines based on the type of heart failure you have, how severe it is, and your response to certain medicines. The following medicines are commonly used to treat heart failure:\n                \nACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also may reduce the risk of a futureheart attack.\n                \nAldosterone antagonists trigger the body to remove excess sodium through urine. This lowers the volume of blood that the heart must pump.\n                \nAngiotensin receptor blockers relax your blood vessels and lower blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload.\n                \nBeta blockers slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload.\n                \nDigoxin makes the heart beat stronger and pump more blood.\n                \nDiuretics (fluid pills) help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles.\n                \nIsosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride helps relax your blood vessels so your heart doesnt work as hard to pump blood. Studies have shown that this medicine can reduce the risk of death in blacks. More studies are needed to find out whether this medicine will benefit other racial groups.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your heart failure.\n                \nOngoing Care\n                \nYou should watch for signs that heart failure is getting worse. For example, weight gain may mean that fluids are building up in your body. Ask your doctor how often you should check your weight and when to report weight changes.\n                \nGetting medical care for other related conditions is important. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, work with your health care team to control these conditions. Have your blood sugar level and blood pressure checked. Talk with your doctor about when you should have tests and how often to take measurements at home.\n                \nTry to avoid respiratory infections like the flu andpneumonia. Talk with your doctor or nurse about getting flu and pneumonia vaccines.\n                \nMany people who have severe heart failure may need treatment in a hospital from time to time. Your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy, which can be given in a hospital or at home.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nAs heart failure worsens, lifestyle changes and medicines may no longer control your symptoms. You may need a medical procedure or surgery.\n                \nIn heart failure, the right and left sides of the heart may no longer contract at the same time. This disrupts the hearts pumping. To correct this problem, your doctor might implant a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (a type ofpacemaker) near your heart. This device helps both sides of your heart contract at the same time, which can decrease heart failure symptoms.\n                \nSome people who have heart failure have very rapid, irregular heartbeats. Without treatment, these heartbeats can causesudden cardiac arrest. Your doctor might implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) near your heart to solve this problem. An ICD checks your heart rate and uses electrical pulses to correct irregular heart rhythms.\n                \nPeople who have severe heart failure symptoms at rest, despite other treatments, may need:\n                \nA mechanical heart pump, such as aleft ventricular assist device. This device helps pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. You may use a heart pump until you have surgery or as a long-term treatment.\n                \nHeart transplant. A heart transplant is an operation in which a persons diseased heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. Heart transplants are done as a life-saving measure for end-stage heart failure when medical treatment and less drastic surgery have failed."

            "question": "What is (are) Cardiomyopathy ?",
            "answer": "Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, signs and symptoms, and treatments.\n                \nIn cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid. In rare cases, the muscle tissue in the heart is replaced with scar tissue.\n                \nAs cardiomyopathy worsens, the heart becomes weaker. It's less able to pump blood through the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm. This can lead to heart failure or irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. In turn, heart failure can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen.\n                \nThe weakening of the heart also can cause other complications, such as heart valve problems.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe types of cardiomyopathy are:\n                \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n                \nDilated cardiomyopathy\n                \nRestrictive cardiomyopathy\n                \nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\n                \nUnclassified cardiomyopathy\n                \nCardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you. Many times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isn't known.\n                \nCardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. However, people in certain age groups are more likely to have certain types of cardiomyopathy. This article focuses on cardiomyopathy in adults.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nSome people who have cardiomyopathy have no signs or symptoms and need no treatment. For other people, the disease develops quickly, symptoms are severe, and serious complications occur.\n                \nTreatments for cardiomyopathy include lifestyle changes, medicines, surgery, implanted devices to correct arrhythmias, and a nonsurgical procedure. These treatments can control symptoms, reduce complications, and stop the disease from getting worse."

Acquired means you arent born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor.\n                \nInherited means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you. Researchers continue to look for the genetic links to cardiomyopathy and to explore how these links cause or contribute to the various types of the disease.\n                \nMany times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isnt known. This often is the case when the disease occurs in children.\n                \nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is inherited. Its caused by a mutation or change in some of the genes in heart muscle proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also can develop over time because of high blood pressure, aging, or other diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid disease. Sometimes the cause of the disease isnt known.\n                \nDilated Cardiomyopathy\n                \nThe cause of dilated cardiomyopathy often isnt known. About one-third of the people who have dilated cardiomyopathy inherit it from their parents.\n                \nCertain diseases, conditions, and substances also can cause the disease, such as:\n                \nAlcohol, especially if you also have a poor diet\n                \nCertain toxins, such as poisons and heavy metals\n                \nComplications during the last months of pregnancy\n                \nCoronary heart disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disease, viral hepatitis, and HIV\n                \nIllegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, and some medicines used to treat cancer\n                \nInfections, especially viral infections that inflame the heart muscle\n                \nRestrictive Cardiomyopathy\n                \nCertain diseases, conditions, and factors can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, including:\n                \nAmyloidosis: A disease in which abnormal proteins build up in the bodys organs, including the heart\n                \nConnective tissue disorders\n                \nHemochromatosis: A disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. The extra iron is toxic to the body and can damage the organs, including the heart.\n                \nSarcoidosis: A disease that causes inflammation and can affect various organs in the body. Researchers believe that an abnormal immune response may cause sarcoidosis. This abnormal response causes tiny lumps of cells to form in the bodys organs, including the heart.\n                \nSome cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy\n                \nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia\n                \nResearchers think that arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is an inherited disease."

            "question": "How to diagnose Cardiomyopathy ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose cardiomyopathy based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nOften, a cardiologist or pediatric cardiologist diagnoses and treats cardiomyopathy. A cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases. A pediatric cardiologist is a cardiologist who treats children.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will want to learn about your medical history. He or she will want to know what signs and symptoms you have and how long you've had them.\n                \nYour doctor also will want to know whether anyone in your family has had cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs for sounds that may suggest cardiomyopathy. These sounds may even suggest a certain type of the disease.\n                \nFor example, the loudness, timing, and location of a heart murmur may suggest obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A \"crackling\" sound in the lungs may be a sign of heart failure. (Heart failure often develops in the later stages of cardiomyopathy.)\n                \nPhysical signs also help your doctor diagnose cardiomyopathy. Swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, or veins in your neck suggests fluid buildup, a sign of heart failure.\n                \nYour doctor may notice signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy during a routine exam. For example, he or she may hear a heart murmur, or you may have abnormal test results.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose cardiomyopathy.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nDuring a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. It's often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\n                \nBlood tests give your doctor information about your heart and help rule out other conditions.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged. A chest x ray also can show whether fluid is building up in your lungs.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nThis test is used to detect and study many heart problems, such as heart attacks, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart failure. EKG results also can suggest other disorders that affect heart function.\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect problems that don't happen during the test.\n                \nTo diagnose heart problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nHolter and event monitors are small, portable devices. They record your heart's electrical activity while you do your normal daily activities. A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period.\n                \nAn event monitor records your heart's electrical activity only at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done as part of a stress test (see below). Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease.\n                \nAnother type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE. TEE provides a view of the back of the heart.\n                \nFor this test, a sound wave wand is put on the end of a special tube. The tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, TEE can create detailed pictures of the heart's structures.\n                \nBefore TEE, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.\n                \nThese tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.\n                \nDiagnostic Procedures\n                \nYou may have one or more medical procedures to confirm a diagnosis or to prepare for surgery (if surgery is planned). These procedures may include cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-i-ZA-shun), coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee), or myocardial (mi-o-KAR-de-al) biopsy.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nThis procedure checks the pressure and blood flow in your heart's chambers. The procedure also allows your doctor to collect blood samples and look at your heart's arteries using x-ray imaging.\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. This allows your doctor to study the inside of your arteries for blockages.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nThis procedure often is done with cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, dye that can be seen on an x ray is injected into your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study blood flow through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nDye also may be injected into your heart chambers. This allows your doctor to study the pumping function of your heart.\n                \nMyocardial Biopsy\n                \nFor this procedure, your doctor removes a piece of your heart muscle. This can be done during cardiac catheterization. The heart muscle is studied under a microscope to see whether changes in cells have occurred. These changes may suggest cardiomyopathy.\n                \nMyocardial biopsy is useful for diagnosing some types of cardiomyopathy.\n                \nGenetic Testing\n                \nSome types of cardiomyopathy run in families. Thus, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to look for the disease in your parents, brothers and sisters, or other family members.\n                \nGenetic testing can show how the disease runs in families. It also can find out the chances of parents passing the genes for the disease on to their children.\n                \nGenetic testing also may be useful if your doctor thinks you have cardiomyopathy, but you don't yet have signs or symptoms. If the test shows you have the disease, your doctor can start treatment early, when it may work best."

            "answer": "People who have cardiomyopathy but no signs or symptoms may not need treatment. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy that comes on suddenly may go away on its own. For other people who have cardiomyopathy, treatment is needed. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy you have, the severity of your symptoms and complications, and your age and overall health. Treatments may include:\n                \nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes\n                \nMedicines\n                \nNonsurgical procedure\n                \nSurgery and implanted devices\n                \nThe main goals of treating cardiomyopathy include:\n                \nControlling signs and symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible\n                \nManaging any conditions that cause or contribute to the disease\n                \nReducing complications and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest\n                \nStopping the disease from getting worse\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may suggest lifestyle changes to manage a condition thats causing your cardiomyopathy including:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats such as stick margarine;baked goods such as, cookies, cakes, and pies, crackers, frostings, and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nTry to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTalk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Your doctor may recommend that you reduce the amount of alcohol you drinkor stop drinking alcohol.\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) onlineBMI calculatoror talk to your doctor.A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visitAssessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \n\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats fasterand you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \n\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMany medicines are used to treat cardiomyopathy. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nBalance electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They also help muscle and nerve tissues work properly. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration (lack of fluid in your body), heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Aldosterone blockers are an example of a medicine used to balance electrolytes.\n                \nKeep your heart beating with a normal rhythm. These medicines, called antiarrhythmics, help prevent arrhythmias.\n                \nLower your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are examples of medicines that lower blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are an example of a medicine that prevents blood clots. Blood thinners often are used to prevent blood clots from forming in people who have dilated cardiomyopathy.\n                \nReduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are an example of a medicine used to reduce inflammation.\n                \nRemove excess sodium from your body. Diuretics, or water pills, are an example of medicines that help remove excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood.\n                \nSlow your heart rate. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are examples of medicines that slow the heart rate. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also are used to lower blood pressure.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\n                \nSurgery and Implanted Devices\n                \nDoctors use several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy, including septal myectomy, surgically implanted devices, and heart transplant.\n                \nSeptal Myectomy\n                \nSeptal myectomy is open-heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms. This surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines arent working well.\n                \nA surgeon removes part of the thickened septum thats bulging into the left ventricle. This improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body. The removed tissue doesnt grow back. If needed, the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time. Septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with nosymptoms.\n                \nSurgically Implanted Devices\n                \nSurgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms, including:\n                \nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. A CRT device coordinates contractions between the hearts left and right ventricles.\n                \nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD). An ICD helps control life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead tosudden cardiac arrest. This small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires. If an ICD senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm, it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.\n                \nLeft ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device helps the heart pump blood to the body. An LVAD can be used as a long-term therapy or as a short-term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant.\n                \nPacemaker. This small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias. The device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n                \nHeart Transplant\n                \nFor this surgery, a surgeon replaces a persons diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. A heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end-stage heart failure. End-stage means the condition has become so severe that all treatments, other than heart transplant, have failed. For more information about this treatment, go to the Heart Transplant Health Topic.\n                \nNonsurgical Procedure\n                \nDoctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy. During this procedure, the doctor injects ethanol (a type of alcohol) through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle. The alcohol kills cells, and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size. This procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle, which improves symptoms."

            "question": "How to prevent Cardiomyopathy ?",
            "answer": "You can't prevent inherited types of cardiomyopathy. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for diseases or conditions that may lead to or complicate cardiomyopathy. Examples includecoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, andheart attack.\n                \nYour doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nAvoiding the use of alcohol and illegal drugs\n                \nGetting enough sleep and rest\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nPhysicalactivity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nYour cardiomyopathy may be due to an underlying disease or condition. If you treat that condition early enough, you may be able to prevent cardiomyopathy complications. For example, to control high blood pressure,high blood cholesterol, and diabetes:\n                \nFollow your doctors advice about lifestyle changes.\n                \nGet regular checkups with your doctor.\n                \nTake all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes."

            "question": "What is (are) Angina ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nAngina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\n                \nAngina isn't a disease; it's a symptom of an underlying heart problem. Angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n                \nCHD is the most common type of heart disease in adults. It occurs if a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up on the inner walls of your coronary arteries. These arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nPlaque Buildup in an Artery\n                \n\n                \nPlaque narrows and stiffens the coronary arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle, causing chest pain. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow, which can cause a heart attack.\n                \nAngina also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). This is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries. In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't create blockages in the arteries like it does in CHD.\n                \nStudies have shown that coronary MVD is more likely to affect women than men. Coronary MVD also is called cardiac syndrome X and nonobstructive CHD.\n                \nTypes of Angina\n                \nThe major types of angina are stable, unstable, variant (Prinzmetal's), and microvascular. Knowing how the types differ is important. This is because they have different symptoms and require different treatments.\n                \nStable Angina\n                \nStable angina is the most common type of angina. It occurs when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern. (Pattern refers to how often the angina occurs, how severe it is, and what factors trigger it.)\n                \nIf you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine.\n                \nStable angina isn't a heart attack, but it suggests that a heart attack is more likely to happen in the future.\n                \nUnstable Angina\n                \nUnstable angina doesn't follow a pattern. It may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion, and rest or medicine may not relieve the pain.\n                \nUnstable angina is very dangerous and requires emergency treatment. This type of angina is a sign that a heart attack may happen soon.\n                \nVariant (Prinzmetal's) Angina\n                \nVariant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Medicine can relieve this type of angina.\n                \nMicrovascular Angina\n                \nMicrovascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina.\n                \nOverview\n                \nExperts believe that nearly 7 million people in the United States suffer from angina. The condition occurs equally among men and women.\n                \nAngina can be a sign of CHD, even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD.\n                \nOther conditions also can cause chest pain, such as:\n                \nPulmonary embolism (a blockage in a lung artery)\n                \nA lung infection\n                \nAortic dissection (tearing of a major artery)\n                \nAortic stenosis (narrowing of the hearts aortic valve)\n                \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; heart muscle disease)\n                \nPericarditis (inflammation in the tissues that surround the heart)\n                \nA panic attack\n                \nAll chest pain should be checked by a doctor."

            "question": "What causes Angina ?",
            "answer": "Underlying Causes\n                \nAngina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD). This means that the underlying causes of angina generally are the same as the underlying causes of CHD.\n                \nResearch suggests that CHD starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nPlaque narrows or blocks the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Some plaque is hard and stable and causes the arteries to become narrow and stiff. This can greatly reduce blood flow to the heart and cause angina.\n                \nOther plaque is soft and more likely to rupture (break open) and cause blood clots. Blood clots can partially or totally block the coronary arteries and cause angina or a heart attack.\n                \nImmediate Causes\n                \nMany factors can trigger angina pain, depending on the type of angina you have.\n                \nStable Angina\n                \nPhysical exertion is the most common trigger of stable angina. Severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you're sitting.\n                \nHowever, with physical exertionlike walking up a hill or climbing stairsthe heart works harder and needs more oxygen.\n                \nOther triggers of stable angina include:\n                \nEmotional stress\n                \nExposure to very hot or cold temperatures\n                \nHeavy meals\n                \nSmoking\n                \nUnstable Angina\n                \nBlood clots that partially or totally block an artery cause unstable angina.\n                \nIf plaque in an artery ruptures, blood clots may form. This creates a blockage. A clot may grow large enough to completely block the artery and cause a heart attack. For more information, go to the animation in \"What Causes a Heart Attack?\"\n                \nBlood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again. Angina can occur each time a clot blocks an artery.\n                \nVariant Angina\n                \nA spasm in a coronary artery causes variant angina. The spasm causes the walls of the artery to tighten and narrow. Blood flow to the heart slows or stops. Variant angina can occur in people who have CHD and in those who dont.\n                \nThe coronary arteries can spasm as a result of:\n                \nExposure to cold\n                \nEmotional stress\n                \nMedicines that tighten or narrow blood vessels\n                \nSmoking\n                \nCocaine use\n                \nMicrovascular Angina\n                \nThis type of angina may be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries.\n                \nReduced blood flow in the small coronary arteries may cause microvascular angina. Plaque in the arteries, artery spasms, or damaged or diseased artery walls can reduce blood flow through the small coronary arteries."

In fact, overall, angina occurs equally among men and women.\n                \nMicrovascular angina, however, occurs more often in women. About 70 percent of the cases of microvascular angina occur in women around the time of menopause.\n                \nUnstable angina occurs more often in older adults. Variant angina is rare; it accounts for only about 2 out of 100 cases of angina. People who have variant angina often are younger than those who have other forms of angina."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Angina ?",
            "answer": "Pain and discomfort are the main symptoms of angina. Angina often is described as pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. The pain or discomfort usually starts behind the breastbone.\n                \nPain from angina also can occur in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. The pain may feel like indigestion. Some people say that angina pain is hard to describe or that they can't tell exactly where the pain is coming from.\n                \nSigns and symptoms such as nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness also may occur.\n                \nWomen are more likely to feel discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. Shortness of breath is more common in older people and those who have diabetes. Weakness, dizziness, and confusion can mask the signs and symptoms of angina in elderly people.\n                \nSymptoms also vary based on the type of angina you have.\n                \nBecause angina has so many possible symptoms and causes, all chest pain should be checked by a doctor.

            "question": "How to diagnose Angina ?",
            "answer": "The most important issues to address when you go to the doctor with chest pain are:\n                \nWhat's causing the chest pain\n                \nWhether you're having or are about to have a heart attack\n                \nAngina is a symptom of an underlying heart problem, usually coronary heart disease (CHD). The type of angina pain you have can be a sign of how severe the CHD is and whether it's likely to cause a heart attack.\n                \nIf you have chest pain, your doctor will want to find out whether it's angina. He or she also will want to know whether the angina is stable or unstable. If it's unstable, you may need emergency medical treatment to try to prevent a heart attack.\n                \nTo diagnose chest pain as stable or unstable angina, your doctor will do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms, and ask about your risk factors for and your family history of CHD or other heart diseases.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask questions about your symptoms, such as:\n                \nWhat brings on the pain or discomfort and what relieves it?\n                \nWhat does the pain or discomfort feel like (for example, heaviness or tightness)?\n                \nHow often does the pain occur?\n                \nWhere do you feel the pain or discomfort?\n                \nHow severe is the pain or discomfort?\n                \nHow long does the pain or discomfort last?\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have unstable angina or that your angina is related to a serious heart condition, he or she may recommend one or more tests.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. However, some people who have angina have normal EKGs.\n                \nStress Testing\n                \nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nWhen your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\n                \nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\n                \nShortness of breath or chest pain\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\n                \nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. They also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. It also can show signs of lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. However, a chest x ray alone is not enough to diagnose angina or CHD.\n                \nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\n                \nYour doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) if he or she suspects you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nCardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter.\n                \nComputed Tomography Angiography\n                \nComputed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) angiography (CTA) uses dye and special x rays to show blood flow through the coronary arteries. This test is less invasive than coronary angiography with cardiac catheterization.\n                \nFor CTA, a needle connected to an intravenous (IV) line is put into a vein in your hand or arm. Dye is injected through the IV line during the scan. You may have a warm feeling when this happens. The dye highlights your blood vessels on the CT scan pictures.\n                \nSticky patches called electrodes are put on your chest. The patches are attached to an EKG machine to record your heart's electrical activity during the scan.\n                \nThe CT scanner is a large machine that has a hollow, circular tube in the middle. You lie on your back on a sliding table. The table slowly slides into the opening of the machine.\n                \nInside the scanner, an x-ray tube moves around your body to take pictures of different parts of your heart. A computer puts the pictures together to make a three-dimensional (3D) picture of the whole heart.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for CHD.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. Some studies suggest that high levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for CHD and heart attack.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Angina ?",
            "answer": "Treatments for angina include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab), and other therapies. The main goals of treatment are to:\n                \nReduce pain and discomfort and how often it occurs\n                \nPrevent or lower your risk for heart attack and death by treating your underlying heart condition\n                \nLifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren't getting worse. If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab.\n                \nUnstable angina is an emergency condition that requires treatment in a hospital.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nMaking lifestyle changes can help prevent episodes of angina. You can:\n                \nSlow down or take rest breaks if physical exertion triggers angina.\n                \nAvoid large meals and rich foods that leave you feeling stuffed if heavy meals trigger angina.\n                \nTry to avoid situations that make you upset or stressed if emotional stress triggers angina. Learn ways to handle stress that can't be avoided.\n                \nYou also can make lifestyle changes that help lower your risk for coronary heart disease. One of the most important changes is to quit smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for CHD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet is another important lifestyle change. A healthy diet can prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.\n                \nA healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas). It also includes whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A healthy diet also is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains.\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBIs Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nOther important lifestyle changes include:\n                \nBeing physically active. Check with your doctor to find out how much and what kinds of activity are safe for you. For more information, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article.\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors.\n                \nTaking all medicines as your doctor prescribes, especially if you have diabetes.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nNitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina. They relax and widen blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the hearts workload.\n                \nNitroglycerin (NI-tro-GLIS-er-in) is the most commonly used nitrate for angina. Nitroglycerin that dissolves under your tongue or between your cheek and gum is used to relieve angina episodes.\n                \nNitroglycerin pills and skin patches are used to prevent angina episodes. However, pills and skin patches act too slowly to relieve pain during an angina attack.\n                \nOther medicines also are used to treat angina, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antiplatelet medicines, or anticoagulants (blood thinners). These medicines can help:\n                \nLower blood pressure and cholesterol levels\n                \nSlow the heart rate\n                \nRelax blood vessels\n                \nReduce strain on the heart\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming\n                \nPeople who have stable angina may be advised to get annual flu shots.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nIf lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need a medical procedure to treat the underlying heart disease. Both angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are commonly used to treat heart disease.\n                \nAngioplasty opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. During angioplasty, a thin tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery.\n                \nOnce in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.\n                \nAngioplasty can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.\n                \nDuring CABG, healthy arteries or veins taken from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. Bypass surgery can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nYou will work with your doctor to decide which treatment is better for you.\n                \nCardiac Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may recommend cardiac rehab for angina or after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.\n                \nThe cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.\n                \nRehab has two parts:\n                \nExercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.\n                \nEducation, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to adjust to a new lifestyle and deal with your fears about the future.\n                \nFor more information about cardiac rehab, go to the DCI Cardiac Rehabilitation article.\n                \nEnhanced External Counterpulsation Therapy\n                \nEnhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is helpful for some people who have angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat.\n                \nEECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically get 35 1-hour treatments over 7 weeks."

            "answer": "Narcolepsy (NAR-ko-lep-se) is a disorder that causes periods of extreme daytime sleepiness. The disorder also may cause muscle weakness.\n                \nMost people who have narcolepsy have trouble sleeping at night. Some people who have the disorder fall asleep suddenly, even if they're in the middle of talking, eating, or another activity.\n                \nNarcolepsy also can cause:\n                \nCataplexy (KAT-ah-plek-se). This condition causes a sudden loss of muscle tone while you're awake. Muscle weakness can affect certain parts of your body or your whole body. For example, if cataplexy affects your hand, you may drop what you're holding. Strong emotions often trigger this weakness. It may last seconds or minutes.\n                \nHallucinations (ha-lu-sih-NA-shuns). These vivid dreams occur while falling asleep or waking up.\n                \nSleep paralysis (pah-RAL-ih-sis). This condition prevents you from moving or speaking while waking up and sometimes while falling asleep. Sleep paralysis usually goes away within a few minutes.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe two main phases of sleep are nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). Most people are in the NREM phase when they first fall asleep. After about 90 minutes of sleep, most people go from NREM to REM sleep.\n                \nDreaming occurs during the REM phase of sleep. During REM, your muscles normally become limp. This prevents you from acting out your dreams. (For more information about sleep cycles, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\")\n                \nPeople who have narcolepsy often fall into REM sleep quickly and wake up directly from it. As a result, they may have vivid dreams while falling asleep and waking up.\n                \nHypocretin (hi-po-KREET-in), a chemical in the brain, helps promote wakefulness. Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of this chemical. What causes these low levels isn't well understood.\n                \nResearchers think that certain factors may work together to cause a lack of hypocretin. These factors may include heredity, infections, brain injuries, and autoimmune disorders. (Autoimmune disorders occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's cells and tissues.)\n                \nOutlook\n                \nNarcolepsy symptoms usually begin during the teen or young adult years.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Narcolepsy ?",
            "answer": "The four major signs and symptoms of narcolepsy are extreme daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (muscle weakness) while awake, and hallucinations and sleep paralysis during sleep.\n                \nIf you have narcolepsy, you may have one or more of these symptoms. They can range from mild to severe. Less than one-third of people who have narcolepsy have all four symptoms.\n                \nExtreme Daytime Sleepiness\n                \nAll people who have narcolepsy have extreme daytime sleepiness. This often is the most obvious symptom of the disorder.\n                \nDuring the day, you may have few or many periods of sleepiness. Each period usually lasts 30minutes or less. Strong emotionssuch as anger, fear, laughter, or excitementcan trigger this sleepiness.\n                \nPeople who have daytime sleepiness often complain of:\n                \nMental cloudiness or \"fog\"\n                \nMemory problems or problems focusing\n                \nLack of energy or extreme exhaustion\n                \nDepression\n                \nSome people who have narcolepsy have episodes in which they fall asleep suddenly. This is more likely to happen when they're not activefor example, while reading, watching TV, or sitting in a meeting.\n                \nHowever, sleep episodes also may occur in the middle of talking, eating, or another activity. Cataplexy also may occur at the same time.\n                \nCataplexy\n                \nThis condition causes loss of muscle tone while you're awake. Muscle weakness affects part or all of your body.\n                \nCataplexy may make your head nod or make it hard for you to speak. Muscle weakness also may make your knees weak or cause you to drop things you're holding. Some people lose all muscle control and fall.\n                \nStrong emotionssuch as anger, surprise, fear, or laughteroften trigger cataplexy. It usually lasts a few seconds or minutes. During this time, you're usually awake.\n                \nCataplexy may occur weeks to years after you first start to have extreme daytime sleepiness.\n                \nHallucinations\n                \nIf you have narcolepsy, you may have vivid dreams while falling asleep, waking up, or dozing. These dreams can feel very real. You may feel like you can see, hear, smell, and taste things.\n                \nSleep Paralysis\n                \nThis condition prevents you from moving or speaking while falling asleep or waking up. However, you're fully conscious (aware) during this time. Sleep paralysis usually lasts just a few seconds or minutes, but it can be scary.\n                \nOther Symptoms\n                \nMost people who have narcolepsy don't sleep well at night. They may have trouble falling and staying asleep. Vivid, scary dreams may disturb sleep. Not sleeping well at night worsens daytime sleepiness.\n                \nRarely, people who fall asleep in the middle of an activity, such as eating, may continue that activity for a few seconds or minutes. This is called automatic behavior.\n                \nDuring automatic behavior, you're not aware of your actions, so you don't do them well. For example, if you're writing before falling asleep, you may scribble rather than form words. If you're driving, you may get lost or have an accident. Most people who have this symptom don't remember what happened while it was going on.\n                \nChildren who have narcolepsy often have trouble studying, focusing, and remembering things. Also, they may seem hyperactive. Some children who have narcolepsy speed up their activities rather than slow them down.\n                \nChildren who have narcolepsy may have severe sleepiness. They may fall asleep while talking or eating, or during sporting events and social activities."

            "question": "How to diagnose Narcolepsy ?",
            "answer": "It can take as long as 10 to 15 years after the first symptoms appear before narcolepsy is recognized and diagnosed. This is because narcolepsy is fairly rare. Also, many narcolepsy symptoms are like symptoms of other illnesses, such as infections, depression, and sleep disorders.\n                \nNarcolepsy sometimes is mistaken for learning problems, seizure disorders, or laziness, especially in school-aged children and teens. When narcolepsy symptoms are mild, the disorder is even harder to diagnose.\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose narcolepsy based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nTell your doctor about any signs and symptoms of narcolepsy that you have. This is important because your doctor may not ask about them during a routine checkup.\n                \nYour doctor will want to know when you first had signs and symptoms and whether they bother your sleep or daily routine. He or she also will want to know about your sleep habits and how you feel and act during the day.\n                \nTo help answer these questions, you may want to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks. Keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep, how much sleep you get at night, and how alert you feel during the day.\n                \nFor a sample sleep diary, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether:\n                \nYou're affected by certain factors that can lead to narcolepsy. Examples of these factors include infections, brain injuries, and autoimmune disorders. Some research suggests that environmental toxins may play a role in triggering narcolepsy.\n                \nYou take medicines and which ones you take. Some medicines can cause daytime sleepiness. Thus, your symptoms may be due to medicine, not narcolepsy.\n                \nYou have symptoms of other sleep disorders that cause daytime sleepiness.\n                \nYou have relatives who have narcolepsy or who have signs or symptoms of the disorder.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check you to see whether another condition is causing your symptoms. For example, infections, certain thyroid diseases, drug and alcohol use, and other medical or sleep disorders may cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nSleep Studies\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have narcolepsy, he or she will likely suggest that you see a sleep specialist. This specialist may advise you to have sleep studies to find out more about your condition.\n                \nSleep studies usually are done at a sleep center. Doctors use the results from two tests to diagnose narcolepsy. These tests are a polysomnogram (PSG) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\n                \nPolysomnogram. You usually stay overnight at a sleep center for a PSG. The test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG can help find out whether you:\n                \nFall asleep quickly\n                \nGo into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep soon after falling asleep\n                \nWake up often during the night\n                \nMultiple sleep latency test. This daytime sleep study measures how sleepy you are. It's often done the day after a PSG. During the test, you're asked to nap for 20minutes every 2 hours throughout the day. (You will nap a total of four or five times.)\n                \nA technician checks your brain activity during this time. He or she notes how quickly you fall asleep and how long it takes you to reach various stages of sleep.\n                \nAn MSLT finds out how quickly you fall asleep during the day (after a full night's sleep). It also shows whether you go into REM sleep soon after falling asleep.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nHypocretin test. This test measures the level of hypocretin in the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord. Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin. Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.\n                \nTo get a sample of spinal cord fluid, a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) is done. For this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle into your lower back area and then withdraws a sample of your spinal fluid."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Narcolepsy ?",
            "answer": "Narcolepsy has no cure. However, medicines, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can relieve many of its symptoms. Treatment for narcolepsy is based on the type of symptoms you have and how severe they are.\n                \nNot all medicines and lifestyle changes work for everyone. It may take weeks to months for you and your doctor to find the best treatment.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYou may need one or more medicines to treat narcolepsy symptoms. These may include:\n                \nStimulants to ease daytime sleepiness and raise your alertness.\n                \nA medicine that helps make up for the low levels of hypocretin in your brain. (Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.) This medicine helps you stay awake during the day and sleep at night. It doesn't always completely relieve daytime sleepiness, so your doctor may tell you to take it with a stimulant.\n                \nMedicines that help you sleep at night.\n                \nMedicines used to treat depression. These medicines also help prevent cataplexy, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.\n                \nSome prescription and over-the-counter medicines can interfere with your sleep. Ask your doctor about these medicines and how to avoid them, if possible. For example, your doctor may advise you to avoid antihistamines. These medicines suppress the action of histamine, a substance in the blood that promotes wakefulness.\n                \nIf you take regular naps when you feel sleepy, you may need less medicine to stay awake.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes also may help relieve some narcolepsy symptoms. You can take steps to make it easier to fall asleep at night and stay asleep.\n                \nFollow a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.\n                \nDo something relaxing before bedtime, such as taking a warm bath.\n                \nKeep your bedroom or sleep area quiet, comfortable, dark, and free from distractions, such as a TV or computer.\n                \nAllow yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep or fall back asleep after waking up. After that, get up and do something relaxing (like reading) until you get sleepy.\n                \nCertain activities, foods, and drinks before bedtime can keep you awake. Try to follow these guidelines:\n                \nExercise regularly, but not within 3 hours of bedtime.\n                \nAvoid tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, and drinks that contain caffeine for several hours before bedtime.\n                \nAvoid large meals and beverages just before bedtime.\n                \nAvoid bright lights before bedtime.\n                \nFor more tips on sleeping better, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nOther Therapies\n                \nLight therapy may help you keep a regular sleep and wake schedule. For this type of therapy, you sit in front of a light box, which has special lights, for 10 to 30 minutes. This therapy can help you feel less sleepy in the morning."

            "question": "What is (are) Immune Thrombocytopenia ?",
            "answer": "Immune thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-toe-PE-ne-ah), or ITP, is a bleeding disorder. In ITP, the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) or thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites).\n                \nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWithout enough platelets, bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding).\n                \nPeople who have ITP often have purple bruises called purpura (PURR-purr-ah). These bruises appear on the skin or mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). Bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin causes purpura.\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have bleeding that causes tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\n                \nPetechiae and Purpura\n                \n\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums during dental work, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal.\n                \nA lot of bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.\n                \nBleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.\n                \nIn most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.\n                \nITP can't be passed from one person to another.\n                \nTypes of Immune Thrombocytopenia\n                \nThe two types of ITP are acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).\n                \nAcute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in childrenboth boys and girlsand is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after a viral infection.\n                \nChronic ITP lasts 6 months or longer and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children do get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women two to three times more often than men.\n                \nTreatment depends on the severity of bleeding and the platelet count. In mild cases, treatment may not be needed.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nFor most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.\n                \nAcute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In 80 percent of children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 to 12 months. Treatment may not be needed.\n                \nFor a small number of children, ITP doesn't go away on its own and may require further medical or surgical treatment.\n                \nChronic ITP varies from person to person and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP can stop treatment at some point and maintain a safe platelet count."

For example, your doctor may look for purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes and pinpoint red spots on the skin. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou'll likely have blood tests to check your platelet count. These tests usually include:\n                \nA complete blood count. This test checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal, but the platelet count is low.\n                \nA blood smear. For this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells.\n                \nYou also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies (proteins) that attack platelets.\n                \nIf blood tests show that your platelet count is low, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is making enough platelets.\n                \nIf you're at risk for HIV, hepatitis C, or H. pylori, your doctor may screen you for these infections, which might be linked to ITP.\n                \nSome people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding.

Adults who have ITP with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated.\n                \nThe acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months.

Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.\n                \nOther medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. Some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin.\n                \nMedicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).\n                \nIf medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat ITP.\n                \nRemoval of the Spleen (Splenectomy)\n                \nIf needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.\n                \nThe spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake.\n                \nIf ITP hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may raise your risk for infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections.\n                \nIf your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nPlatelet Transfusions\n                \nSome people who have ITP with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery.\n                \nFor a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.\n                \nFor more information about platelet transfusions, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nTreating Infections\n                \nSome infections can briefly lower your platelet count. Treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.\n                \nStopping Medicines\n                \nSome medicines can lower your platelet count or cause bleeding. Stopping the medicine can sometimes help raise your platelet count or prevent bleeding.\n                \nFor example, aspirin and ibuprofen are common medicines that increase the risk of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines."

            "answer": "An electrocardiogram (e-lek-tro-KAR-de-o-gram), also called an EKG or ECG, is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. To understand this test, it helps to understand how the heart works.\n                \nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. The process repeats with each new heartbeat.\n                \nThe heart's electrical signals set the rhythm of the heartbeat. For more detailed information and animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.\n                \nAn EKG shows:\n                \nHow fast your heart is beating\n                \nWhether the rhythm of your heartbeat is steady or irregular\n                \nThe strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart\n                \nDoctors use EKGs to detect and study many heart problems, such as heart attacks, arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), and heart failure.

The patches are about the size of a quarter.\n                \nOften, 12 patches are attached to your body. This helps detect your heart's electrical activity from many areas at the same time. The nurse may have to shave areas of your skin to help the patches stick.\n                \nAfter the patches are placed on your skin, you'll lie still on a table while the patches detect your heart's electrical signals. A machine will record these signals on graph paper or display them on a screen.\n                \nThe entire test will take about 10 minutes.\n                \nEKG\n                \n\n                \nSpecial Types of Electrocardiogram\n                \nThe standard EKG described above, called a resting 12-lead EKG, only records seconds of heart activity at a time.

            "question": "What is (are) Diabetic Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "The term \"diabetic heart disease\" (DHD) refers to heart disease that develops in people who have diabetes. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have diabetes:\n                \nAre at higher risk for heart disease\n                \nHave additional causes of heart disease\n                \nMay develop heart disease at a younger age\n                \nMay have more severe heart disease\n                \nWhat Is Diabetes?\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body doesn't make enough insulin. This causes the body's blood sugar level to rise.\n                \nIn type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly (a condition called insulin resistance). At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, though, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\n                \nFor more information about diabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Introduction to Diabetes Web page.\n                \nWhat Heart Diseases Are Involved in Diabetic Heart Disease?\n                \nDHD may include coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee).\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nIn CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nCHD can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh), irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart attack, or even death.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. The term heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\n                \nIf you have heart failure, you may tire easily and have to limit your activities. CHD can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart muscle over time.\n                \nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nDiabetic cardiomyopathy is a disease that damages the structure and function of the heart. This disease can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias, even in people who have diabetes but don't have CHD.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPeople who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop DHD. The higher a person's blood sugar level is, the higher his or her risk of DHD.\n                \nDiabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways.\n                \nFirst, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease, just like smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. In fact, people who have type 2 diabetes have the same risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease as people who already have had heart attacks.\n                \nSecond, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Although research is ongoing, it's clear that diabetes and other conditionssuch as overweight and obesity and metabolic syndromeinteract to cause harmful physical changes to the heart.\n                \nThird, diabetes raises the risk of earlier and more severe heart problems. Also, people who have DHD tend to have less success with some heart disease treatments, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,also known as coronary angioplasty.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIf you have diabetes, you can lower your risk of DHD. Making lifestyle changes and taking prescribed medicines can help you prevent or control many risk factors.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. For example, physical activity can lower your blood pressure, help control your blood sugar level and your weight, and reduce stress.\n                \nIt's also very important to follow your treatment plan for diabetes and see your doctor for ongoing care.\n                \nIf you already have DHD, follow your treatment plan as your doctors advises. This may help you avoid or delay serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure."

            "question": "What causes Diabetic Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "At least four complex processes, alone or combined, can lead to diabetic heart disease (DHD). They include coronary atherosclerosis; metabolic syndrome; insulin resistance in people who have type 2 diabetes; and the interaction of coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nResearchers continue to study these processes because all of the details aren't yet known.\n                \nCoronary Atherosclerosis\n                \nAtherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that it is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. The disease develops faster as you age.\n                \nCoronary atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots narrow the coronary arteries even more. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and may worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of both CHD and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nIf you have three or more of the five metabolic risk factors, you have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors are:\n                \nA large waistline (a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men).\n                \nA high triglyceride (tri-GLIH-seh-ride) level (or youre on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\n                \nA low HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nHigh blood pressure (or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nA high fasting blood sugar level (or you're on medicine to treat high blood sugar).\n                \nIt's unclear whether these risk factors have a common cause or are mainly related by their combined effects on the heart.\n                \nObesity seems to set the stage for metabolic syndrome. Obesity can cause harmful changes in body fats and how the body uses insulin.\n                \nChronic (ongoing) inflammation also may occur in people who have metabolic syndrome. Inflammation is the body's response to illness or injury. It may raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. Inflammation also may contribute to or worsen metabolic syndrome.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to learn more about metabolic syndrome and how metabolic risk factors interact.\n                \nInsulin Resistance in People Who Have Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nType 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that the body can't properly use the insulin it makes.\n                \nPeople who have type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have higher levels of substances in the blood that cause blood clots. Blood clots can block the coronary arteries and cause a heart attack or even death.\n                \nThe Interaction of Coronary Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, and Diabetes\n                \nEach of these risk factors alone can damage the heart. CHD reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. High blood pressure and diabetes may cause harmful changes in the structure and function of the heart.\n                \nHaving CHD, high blood pressure, and diabetes is even more harmful to the heart. Together, these conditions can severely damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has to work harder than normal. Over time, the heart weakens and isnt able to pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. This condition is called heart failure.\n                \nAs the heart weakens, the body may release proteins and other substances into the blood. These proteins and substances also can harm the heart and worsen heart failure."

Third, compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are more likely to:\n                \nHave heart attacks and other heart and blood vessel diseases. In men, the risk is double; in women, the risk is triple.\n                \nHave more complications after a heart attack, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure.\n                \nDie from heart disease.\n                \nThe higher your blood sugar level is, the higher your risk of DHD. (A higher than normal blood sugar level is a risk factor for heart disease even in people who don't have diabetes.)\n                \nType 2 diabetes raises your risk of having silent heart diseasethat is, heart disease with no signs or symptoms. You can even have a heart attack without feeling symptoms. Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed.\n                \nOther Risk Factors\n                \nOther factors also can raise the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. You can control most of these risk factors, but some you can't.\n                \nFor a more detailed discussion of these risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors article.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can Control\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol).\n                \nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body's tissues.\n                \nPrediabetes. This is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. If you have prediabetes and don't take steps to manage it, you'll likely develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.\n                \nOverweight or obesity. Being overweight or obese raises your risk of heart disease and heart attack. Overweight and obesity also are linked to other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome also raises your risk of other health problems, such as stroke.\n                \nLack of physical activity. Lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for heart disease, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk of heart disease. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nStress. Stress and anxiety can trigger your arteries to tighten. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk of having a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk of heart disease if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can't Control\n                \nAge. As you get older, your risk of heart disease and heart attack rises. In men, the risk of heart disease increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55. In people who have diabetes, the risk of heart disease increases after age 40.\n                \nGender. Before age 55, women seem to have a lower risk of heart disease than men. After age 55, however, the risk of heart disease increases similarly in both women and men.\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.\n                \nPreeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."

Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed.\n                \nThus, people who have diabetes should have regular medical checkups. Tests may reveal a problem before they're aware of it. Early treatment can reduce or delay related problems.\n                \nSome people who have DHD will have some or all of the typical symptoms of heart disease. Be aware of the symptoms described below and seek medical care if you have them.\n                \nIf you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care. Treatment for a heart attack works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nA common symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD) is angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\n                \nSee your doctor if you think you have angina. He or she may recommend tests to check your coronary arteries and to see whether you have CHD risk factors.\n                \nOther CHD signs and symptoms include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness.\n                \nSome people don't realize they have CHD until they have a heart attack. A heart attack occurs if a blood clot forms in a coronary artery and blocks blood flow to part of the heart muscle.\n                \nThe most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back.\n                \nThe discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. The feeling can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn. Shortness of breath may occur with or before chest discomfort.\n                \nHeart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms include nausea, vomiting, light-headedness or sudden dizziness, breaking out in a cold sweat, sleep problems, fatigue, and lack of energy.\n                \nSome heart attack symptoms are similar to angina symptoms. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack.\n                \nIf you don't know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care.\n                \nNot everyone who has a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. Also, diabetes-related nerve damage can interfere with pain signals in the body. As a result, some people who have diabetes may have heart attacks without symptoms.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nThe most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing, fatigue, and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in your neck. As the heart weakens, heart failure symptoms worsen.\n                \nPeople who have heart failure can live longer and more active lives if the condition is diagnosed early and they follow their treatment plans. If you have any form of DHD, talk with your doctor about your risk of heart failure.\n                \nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nDiabetic cardiomyopathy may not cause symptoms in its early stages. Later, you may have weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet."

Abnormal levels of these substances may show that you're at risk for DHD.\n                \nA blood test also can check the level of a hormone called BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in your blood. The heart makes BNP, and the level of BNP rises during heart failure.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. Stress testing gives your doctor information about how your heart works during physical stress.\n                \nDuring a stress test, you exercise (walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Tests are done on your heart while you exercise. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nFor this test, you'll give a sample of urine for analysis. The sample is checked for abnormal levels of protein or blood cells. In people who have diabetes, protein in the urine is a risk factor for DHD.\n                \nOther Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may refer you to a cardiologist if your initial test results suggest that you have a form of DHD. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nThe cardiologist may recommend other tests or procedures to get more detailed information about the nature and extent of your DHD.\n                \nFor more information about other tests and procedures, go to the diagnosis sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Diabetic Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is treated with lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treating DHD include:\n                \nControlling diabetes and any other heart disease risk factors you have, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure\n                \nReducing or relieving heart disease symptoms, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort)\n                \nPreventing or delaying heart disease complications, such as a heart attack\n                \nRepairing heart and coronary artery damage\n                \nFollowing the treatment plan your doctor recommends is very important. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are at higher risk for heart disease, have additional causes of heart disease, may develop heart disease at a younger age, and may have more severe heart disease.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle is an important part of treating diabetes and DHD. Some people who have diabetes can manage their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes alone.\n                \nFollowing a Healthy Diet\n                \nA healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nControlling your weight helps you control heart disease risk factors. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.\n                \nFor more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nBeing Physically Active\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many heart disease risk factors, and it helps control your blood sugar level. Physical activity also can improve how insulin works. (Insulin is a hormone that helps turn glucose into energy.)\n                \nGenerally, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. You dont have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about what types and amounts and physical activity are safe for you. People who have diabetes must be careful to watch their blood sugar levels and avoid injury to their feet during physical activity.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nSmoking can damage your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that strong emotions, such as anger, can trigger a heart attack. Learning how to managestress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines are an important part of treatment for people who have diabetes and for people who have DHD.\n                \nMedicines can help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce the heart's workload, and treat angina symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor will prescribe medicines based on your specific needs.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nIf you have DHD, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\n                \nFor example, both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),also known as coronaryangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Both of these procedures improve blood flow to your heart. PCI also can relieve chest pain. CABG can relieve chest pain and may help prevent a heart attack.\n                \nIf you have heart damage and severe heart failure symptoms, your doctor may recommend a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\n                \nA CRT device is a type of pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control abnormal heart rhythms. Its placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. A CRT device helps the heart's lower chambers contract at the same time, which may decrease heart failure symptoms.\n                \nAn ICD is similar to a pacemaker. An ICD is a small device thats placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. The device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control dangerous heart rhythms.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a pacemaker or ICD to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other types of surgery also are used to treat this type of heart disease.\n                \nFor more information about medical procedures used to treat diabetes-related heart diseases, go to the treatment sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles.\n                \nDiabetes-Specific Treatment Issues\n                \nThe treatments described above are used for people who have DHD and for people who have heart disease without diabetes. However, some aspects of heart disease treatment differ for people who have diabetes.\n                \nTreatment for High Blood Pressure and High Blood Cholesterol\n                \nTreatment for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol often begins earlier in people who have diabetes than in those who don't. People who have diabetes also may have more aggressive treatment goals.\n                \nFor example, your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins even if your blood cholesterol levels are in the normal range. Your doctor also may prescribe statins if you're older than 40 and have other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nTarget goals for LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and high blood pressure also are lower for people who have diabetes than for those who don't. Studies suggest that most people who have diabetes will need more than one blood pressure medicine to reach their goals.\n                \nResearch also has shown that some people who have diabetes may benefit more from certain blood pressure and cholesterol medicines than from others.\n                \nOne example is a group of cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine). This type of medicine may offer advantages for people who have type 2 diabetes. It appears to improve blood sugar control and lower LDL cholesterol.\n                \nTreatment for Heart Failure\n                \nSome studies suggest that certain medicines may have advantages for treating heart failure in people who have diabetes. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers.\n                \nResearch shows that two blood sugar medicines (insulin and sulfanylureas) don't seem to reduce the risk of heart failure in people who have type 2 diabetes. A third medicine (metformin) shows promise, but research is still ongoing.\n                \nHeart Attack Prevention\n                \nDoctors may recommend aspirin for people with diabetes who are at increased risk for heart disease and heart attack. Taken each day, low-dose aspirin may prevent blood clots that can lead to a heart attack.\n                \nPeople with diabetes who are at increased risk include most men older than 50 and most women older than 60 who have one or more of the following risk factors:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol\n                \nA family history of early heart disease\n                \nA higher than normal level of protein in their urine\n                \nBlood Sugar Control\n                \nControlling blood sugar levels is good for heart health. For example, controlling blood sugar improves everyday heart function for people who have diabetes and heart failure."

Your risk of heart disease increases with the number of risk factors you have.\n                \nOne step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. A healthy lifestyle includes:\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nBeing physically active\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nYou also should know your family history of diabetes and heart disease. If you or someone in your family has diabetes, heart disease, or both, let your doctor know.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to control certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.

            "question": "What is (are) Holes in the Heart ?",
            "answer": "Holes in the heart are simple congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nThe heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.\n                \nThe septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.\n                \nA hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).\n                \nASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.\n                \nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs and VSDs have greatly improved. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired."

            "question": "What causes Holes in the Heart ?",
            "answer": "Mothers of children who are born with atrial septal defects (ASDs), ventricular septal defects (VSDs), or other heart defects may think they did something wrong during their pregnancies. However, most of the time, doctors don't know why congenital heart defects occur.\n                \nHeredity may play a role in some heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect is slightly more likely than other people to have a child who has the problem. Very rarely, more than one child in a family is born with a heart defect.\n                \nChildren who have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, often have congenital heart defects. Half of all babies who have Down syndrome have congenital heart defects.\n                \nSmoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects.\n                \nScientists continue to search for the causes of congenital heart defects."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Holes in the Heart ?",
            "answer": "Atrial Septal Defect\n                \nMany babies who are born with atrial septal defects (ASDs) have no signs or symptoms. However, as they grow, these children may be small for their age. \n                \nWhen signs and symptoms do occur, a heart murmur is the most common. A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat.\n                \nOften, a heart murmur is the only sign of an ASD. However, not all murmurs are signs of congenital heart defects. Many healthy children have heart murmurs. Doctors can listen to heart murmurs and tell whether they're harmless or signs of heart problems.\n                \nIf a large ASD isn't repaired, the extra blood flow to the right side of the heart can damage the heart and lungs and cause heart failure. This generally doesn't occur until adulthood. Signs and symptoms of heart failure include:\n                \nFatigue (tiredness)\n                \nTiring easily during physical activity\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nA buildup of blood and fluid in the lungs\n                \nSwelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck\n                \nVentricular Septal Defect\n                \nBabies born with ventricular septal defects (VSDs) usually have heart murmurs. Murmurs may be the first and only sign of a VSD. Heart murmurs often are present right after birth in many infants. However, the murmurs may not be heard until the babies are 6 to 8 weeks old.\n                \nMost newborns who have VSDs don't have heart-related symptoms. However, babies who have medium or large VSDs can develop heart failure. Signs and symptoms of heart failure usually occur during the baby's first 2 months of life.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of heart failure due to VSD are similar to those listed above for ASD, but they occur in infancy.\n                \nA major sign of heart failure in infancy is poor feeding and growth. VSD signs and symptoms are rare after infancy. This is because the defects either decrease in size on their own or they're repaired."

        {
            "question": "How to diagnose Holes in the Heart ?",
            "answer": "Doctors usually diagnose holes in the heart based on a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures. The exam findings for an atrial septal defect (ASD) often aren't obvious. Thus, the diagnosis sometimes isn't made until later in childhood or even in adulthood.\n                \nVentricular septal defects (VSDs) cause a very distinct heart murmur. Because of this, a diagnosis usually is made in infancy.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nDoctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems are called cardiologists. Pediatric cardiologists take care of babies and children who have heart problems. Cardiac surgeons repair heart defects using surgery.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring a physical exam, your child's doctor will listen to your child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope. The doctor also will look for signs of a heart defect, such as a heart murmur or signs of heart failure.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour child's doctor may recommend several tests to diagnose an ASD or VSD. These tests also will help the doctor figure out the location and size of the defect.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. The sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.\n                \nEcho allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.\n                \nEcho is an important test for both diagnosing a hole in the heart and following the problem over time. Echo can show problems with the heart's structure and how the heart is reacting to the problems. This test will help your child's cardiologist decide whether and when treatment is needed.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can detect whether one of the heart's chambers is enlarged, which can help diagnose a heart problem.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nThis test can show whether the heart is enlarged. A chest x ray also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.\n                \nPulse Oximetry\n                \nPulse oximetry shows the level of oxygen in the blood. A small sensor is attached to a finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in the blood.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-i-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart.\n                \nSpecial dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the heart's chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.\n                \nThe doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart.\n                \nDoctors also use cardiac catheterization to repair some heart defects.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Holes in the Heart ?",
            "answer": "Many holes in the heart don't need treatment, but some do. Those that do often are repaired during infancy or early childhood. Sometimes adults are treated for holes in the heart if problems develop.\n                \nThe treatment your child receives depends on the type, location, and size of the hole. Other factors include your child's age, size, and general health.\n                \nTreating an Atrial Septal Defect\n                \nIf a child has an atrial septal defect (ASD), routine checkups are done to see whether it closes on its own. About half of all ASDs close on their own over time, and about 20 percent close within the first year of life.\n                \nYour child's doctor will let you know how often your child should have checkups. For an ASD, frequent checkups aren't needed.\n                \nIf an ASD requires treatment, catheter or surgical procedures are used to close the hole. Doctors often decide to close ASDs in children who still have medium- or large-sized holes by the time they're 2 to 5 years old.\n                \nCatheter Procedure\n                \nUntil the early 1990s, surgery was the usual method for closing all ASDs. Now, thanks to medical advances, doctors can use catheter procedures to close secundum ASDs. These are the most common type of ASD.\n                \nBefore a catheter procedure, your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. Then, the doctor inserts a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into a vein in the groin (upper thigh). He or she threads the tube to the heart's septum. A device made up of two small disks or an umbrella-like device is attached to the catheter.\n                \nWhen the catheter reaches the septum, the device is pushed out of the catheter. The device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria. It's secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body.\n                \nWithin 6 months, normal tissue grows in and over the device. The closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows.\n                \nDoctors often use echocardiography (echo), transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE), and coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) to guide them in threading the catheter to the heart and closing the defect. TEE is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.\n                \nCatheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery. They involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter is inserted. This means that recovery is faster and easier.\n                \nThe outlook for children having this procedure is excellent. Closures are successful in more than 9 out of 10 patients, with no major leakage. Rarely, a defect is too large for catheter closure and surgery is needed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nOpen-heart surgery generally is done to repair primum or sinus venosus ASDs. Before the surgery, your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain.\n                \nThen, the cardiac surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the chest to reach the ASD. He or she repairs the defect with a special patch that covers the hole. A heart-lung bypass machine is used during the surgery so the surgeon can open the heart. The machine takes over the heart's pumping action and moves blood away from the heart.\n                \nThe outlook for children who have ASD surgery is excellent. On average, children spend 3 to 4 days in the hospital before going home. Complications, such as bleeding and infection, are very rare.\n                \nIn some children, the outer lining of the heart may become inflamed. This condition is called pericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis). The inflammation causes fluid to collect around the heart in the weeks after surgery. Medicine usually can treat this condition.\n                \nWhile in the hospital, your child will be given medicine as needed to reduce pain or anxiety. The doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home.\n                \nThey will talk about preventing blows to the chest as the incision heals, limiting activity while your child recovers, bathing, scheduling ongoing care, and deciding when your child can go back to his or her regular activities.\n                \nTreating a Ventricular Septal Defect\n                \nDoctors may choose to monitor children who have ventricular septal defects (VSDs) but no symptoms of heart failure. This means regular checkups and tests to see whether the defect closes on its own or gets smaller.\n                \nMore than half of VSDs eventually close, usually by the time children are in preschool. Your child's doctor will let you know how often your child needs checkups. Checkups may range from once a month to once every 1 or 2 years.\n                \nIf treatment for a VSD is required, options include extra nutrition and surgery to close the VSD. Doctors also can use catheter procedures to close some VSDs. They may use this approach if surgery isn't possible or doesn't work. More research is needed to find out the risks and benefits of using catheter procedures to treat VSDs.\n                \nExtra Nutrition\n                \nSome infants who have VSDs don't grow and develop or gain weight as they should. These infants usually:\n                \nHave large VSDs\n                \nAre born too early\n                \nTire easily during feeding\n                \nDoctors usually recommend extra nutrition or special feedings for these infants. These feedings are high-calorie formulas or breast milk supplements that give babies extra nourishment.\n                \nSome infants need tube feeding. A small tube is inserted into the mouth and moved down into the stomach. Food is given through the tube.\n                \nTube feeding can add to or take the place of bottle feeding. This treatment often is short-term because a VSD that causes symptoms will likely require surgery.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nMost doctors recommend surgery to close large VSDs that are causing symptoms, affecting the aortic valve, or haven't closed by the time children are 1 year old. Surgery may be needed earlier if:\n                \nA child doesn't gain weight\n                \nMedicines are needed to control the symptoms of heart failure\n                \nRarely, medium-sized VSDs that are causing enlarged heart chambers are treated with surgery after infancy. However, most VSDs that require surgery are repaired in the first year of life. Doctors use open-heart surgery and patches to close VSDs."

            "question": "What is (are) Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors ?",
            "answer": "Coronary heart disease risk factors are conditions or habits that raise your risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack. These risk factors also increase the chance that existing CHD will worsen.\n                \nCHD, also called coronary artery disease, is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up on the inner walls of the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Reduced blood flow can cause chest pain, especially when you're active. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque.\n                \nIf the clot becomes large enough, it can block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery. Blocked blood flow to the heart muscle causes a heart attack.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThere are many known CHD risk factors. You can control some risk factors, but not others. Risk factors you can control include:\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels (a type of fat found in the blood)\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nDiabetes and prediabetes\n                \nOverweight and obesity\n                \nSmoking\n                \nLack of physical activity\n                \nUnhealthy diet\n                \nStress\n                \nThe risk factors you can't control are age, gender, and family history of CHD.\n                \nMany people have at least one CHD risk factor. Your risk of CHD and heart attack increases with the number of risk factors you have and their severity. Also, some risk factors put you at greater risk of CHD and heart attack than others. Examples of these risk factors include smoking and diabetes.\n                \nMany risk factors for coronary heart disease start during childhood. This is even more common now because many children are overweight and dont get enough physical activity.\n                \nResearchers continue to study and learn more about CHD risk factors.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle can help you and your children prevent or control many CHD risk factors.\n                \nBecause many lifestyle habits begin during childhood, parents and families should encourage their children to make heart healthy choices. For example, you and your children can lower your risk of CHD if you maintain a healthy weight, follow a healthy diet, do physical activity regularly, and don't smoke.\n                \nIf you already have CHD, lifestyle changes can help you control your risk factors. This may prevent CHD from worsening. Even if you're in your seventies or eighties, a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of dying from CHD.\n                \nIf lifestyle changes aren't enough, your doctor may recommend other treatments to help control your risk factors.\n                \nYour doctor can help you find out whether you have CHD risk factors. He or she also can help you create a plan for lowering your risk of CHD, heart attack, and other heart problems.\n                \nIf you have children, talk with their doctors about their heart health and whether they have CHD risk factors. If they do, ask your doctor to help create a treatment plan to reduce or control these risk factors."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors? ?",
            "answer": "High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels\n                \nCholesterol\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol is a condition in which your blood has too much cholesterola waxy, fat-like substance. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack.\n                \nCholesterol travels through the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins. Two major kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body:\n                \nLow-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL cholesterol sometimes is called \"bad\" cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. A high LDL cholesterol level raises your risk of CHD.\n                \nHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL cholesterol sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A low HDL cholesterol level raises your risk of CHD.\n                \nMany factors affect your cholesterol levels. For example, after menopause, women's LDL cholesterol levels tend to rise, and their HDL cholesterol levels tend to fall. Other factorssuch as age, gender, diet, and physical activityalso affect your cholesterol levels.\n                \nHealthy levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol will prevent plaque from building up in your arteries. Routine blood tests can show whether your blood cholesterol levels are healthy. Talk with your doctor about having your cholesterol tested and what the results mean.\n                \nChildren also can have unhealthy cholesterol levels, especially if they're overweight or their parents have high blood cholesterol. Talk with your child's doctor about testing your child' cholesterol levels.\n                \nTo learn more about high blood cholesterol and how to manage the condition, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article.\n                \nTriglycerides\n                \nTriglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of CHD, especially in women.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \n\"Blood pressure\" is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to plaque buildup.All levels above 120/80 mmHg raise your risk of CHD. This risk grows as blood pressure levels rise. Only one of the two blood pressure numbers has to be above normal to put you at greater risk of CHD and heart attack.\n                \n\n                \nMost adults should have their blood pressure checked at least once a year. If you have high blood pressure, you'll likely need to be checked more often. Talk with your doctor about how often you should have your blood pressure checked.\n                \nChildren also can develop high blood pressure, especially if they're overweight. Your child's doctor should check your child's blood pressure at each routine checkup.\n                \nBoth children and adults are more likely to develop high blood pressure if they're overweight or have diabetes.\n                \nFor more information about high blood pressure and how to manage the condition, go to the Health Topics High Blood Pressure article.\n                \nDiabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood sugar level is too high. The two types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2.\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, the body's blood sugar level is high because the body doesn't make enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it's used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, the body's blood sugar level is high mainly because the body doesn't use its insulin properly.\n                \nOver time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries. Having diabetes doubles your risk of CHD.\n                \nPrediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. If you have prediabetes and don't take steps to manage it, you'll likely develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. You're also at higher risk of CHD.\n                \nBeing overweight or obese raises your risk of type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, people who have prediabetes may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. They also may be able to lower their risk of CHD and heart attack. Weight loss and physical activity also can help control diabetes.\n                \nEven children can develop type 2 diabetes. Most children who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops over time and sometimes has no symptoms. Go to your doctor or local clinic to have your blood sugar levels tested regularly to check for diabetes and prediabetes.\n                \nFor more information about diabetes and heart disease, go to the Health Topics Diabetic Heart Disease article. For more information about diabetes and prediabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' (NIDDK's) Introduction to Diabetes.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity\n                \nThe terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight, and almost one-third of these adults are obese.\n                \nThe most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI).You can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nOverweight is defined differently for children and teens than it is for adults. Children are still growing, and boys and girls mature at different rates. Thus, BMIs for children and teens compare their heights and weights against growth charts that take age and gender into account. This is called BMI-for-age percentile.\n                \nBeing overweight or obese can raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. This is mainly because overweight and obesity are linked to other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nSmoking\n                \nSmoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk of CHD and heart attack.\n                \nSmoking triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Smoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. Blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack.Some research shows that smoking raises your risk of CHD in part by lowering HDL cholesterol levels.\n                \nThe more you smoke, the greater your risk of heart attack. The benefits of quitting smoking occur no matter how long or how much you've smoked. Heart disease risk associated with smoking begins to decrease soon after you quit, and for many people it continues to decrease over time.\n                \nMost people who smoke start when they're teens. Parents can help prevent their children from smoking by not smoking themselves. Talk with your child about the health dangers of smoking and ways to overcome peer pressure to smoke.\n                \nFor more information, including tips on how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nFor more information about children and smoking, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS') Kids and Smoking Web page and the CDC's Smoking and Tobacco Use Web page.\n                \nLack of Physical Activity\n                \nInactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop CHD as those who are active. A lack of physical activity can worsen other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n                \nIt's important for children and adults to make physical activity part of their daily routines. One reason many Americans aren't active enough is because of hours spent in front of TVs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities.\n                \nSome experts advise that children and teens should reduce screen time because it limits time for physical activity. They recommend that children aged 2 and older should spend no more than 2 hours a day watching TV or using a computer (except for school work).\n                \nBeing physically active is one of the most important things you can do to keep your heart healthy. The good news is that even modest amounts of physical activity are good for your health. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\n                \nFor more information, go to HHS' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nUnhealthy Diet\n                \nAn unhealthy diet can raise your risk of CHD. For example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise LDL cholesterol. Thus, you should try to limit these foods.\n                \nIt's also important to limit foods that are high in sodium (salt) and added sugars. A high-salt diet can raise your risk of high blood pressure.\n                \nAdded sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. This can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk of CHD. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruits packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet sodas.\n                \nStress\n                \nStress and anxiety may play a role in causing CHD. Stress and anxiety also can trigger your arteries to tighten. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk of heart attack.\n                \nThe most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk of CHD if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.\n                \nAge\n                \nIn men, the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) increases starting around age 45. In women, the risk for CHD increases starting around age 55. Most people have some plaque buildup in their heart arteries by the time theyre in their 70s. However, only about 25 percent of those people have chest pain, heart attacks, or other signs of CHD.\n                \nGender\n                \nSome risk factors may affect CHD risk differently in women than in men. For example, estrogen provides women some protection against CHD, whereas diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women than in men.\n                \nAlso, some risk factors for heart disease only affect women, such as preeclampsia, a condition that can develop during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure. (Likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases a womans risk of preeclampsia.)\n                \nFamily History\n                \nA family history of early CHD is a risk factor for developing CHD, specifically if a father or brother is diagnosed before age 55, or a mother or sister is diagnosed before age 65."

            "question": "How to prevent Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors ?",
            "answer": "You can prevent and control many coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors with heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Examples of risk factors you can control include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and overweight and obesity. Only a few risk factorssuch as age, gender, and family historycant be controlled.\n                \nTo reduce your risk of CHD and heart attack, try to control each risk factor you can. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control several CHD risk factors at the same time. For example, physical activity may lower your blood pressure, help control diabetes and prediabetes, reduce stress, and help control your weight.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nA heart-healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of CHD. If you already have CHD, a heart-healthy lifestyle may prevent it from getting worse. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nMany lifestyle habits begin during childhood. Thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make heart-healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. Make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. Making lifestyle changes can be hard.

Ways to Enhance Childrens Activity & Nutrition.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out NHLBIs online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program.\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent CHD.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nCoronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\n                \nLower your blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\n                \nPrevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. \n                \nReduce your hearts workload and relieve CHD.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes.

            "question": "What is (are) Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n                \nIf you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches.\n                \nSevere or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nBlood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood).\n                \nRed blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. They carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. These cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones.\n                \nWhite blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. With some types of anemia, you may have low numbers of all three types of blood cells.\n                \nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMany types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated. You can even prevent some types with a healthy diet. Other types can be treated with dietary supplements.\n                \nHowever, certain types of anemia can be severe, long lasting, and even life threatening if not diagnosed and treated.\n                \nIf you have signs or symptoms of anemia, see your doctor to find out whether you have the condition. Treatment will depend on the cause of the anemia and how severe it is."

            "question": "What causes Anemia ?",
            "answer": "The three main causes of anemia are:\n                \nBlood loss\n                \nLack of red blood cell production\n                \nHigh rates of red blood cell destruction\n                \nFor some people, the condition is caused by more than one of these factors.\n                \nBlood Loss\n                \nBlood loss is the most common cause of anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time.\n                \nHeavy menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss.\n                \nIf a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anemia.\n                \nLack of Red Blood Cell Production\n                \nBoth acquired and inherited conditions and factors can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.\n                \nAcquired conditions and factors that can lead to anemia include poor diet, abnormal hormone levels, some chronic (ongoing) diseases, and pregnancy.\n                \nAplastic anemia also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be acquired or inherited.\n                \nDiet\n                \nA diet that lacks iron, folic acid (folate), or vitamin B12 can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Your body also needs small amounts of vitamin C, riboflavin, and copper to make red blood cells.\n                \nConditions that make it hard for your body to absorb nutrients also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells.\n                \nHormones\n                \nYour body needs the hormone erythropoietin (eh-rith-ro-POY-eh-tin) to make red blood cells. This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to make these cells. A low level of this hormone can lead to anemia.\n                \nDiseases and Disease Treatments\n                \nChronic diseases, like kidney disease and cancer, can make it hard for your body to make enough red blood cells.\n                \nSome cancer treatments may damage the bone marrow or damage the red blood cells' ability to carry oxygen. If the bone marrow is damaged, it can't make red blood cells fast enough to replace the ones that die or are destroyed.\n                \nPeople who have HIV/AIDS may develop anemia due to infections or medicines used to treat their diseases.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nAnemia can occur during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid and changes in the blood.\n                \nDuring the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman's blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia.\n                \nAplastic Anemia\n                \nSome infants are born without the ability to make enough red blood cells. This condition is called aplastic anemia. Infants and children who have aplastic anemia often need blood transfusions to increase the number of red blood cells in their blood.\n                \nAcquired conditions or factors, such as certain medicines, toxins, and infectious diseases, also can cause aplastic anemia.\n                \nHigh Rates of Red Blood Cell Destruction\n                \nBoth acquired and inherited conditions and factors can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells. One example of an acquired condition is an enlarged or diseased spleen.\n                \nThe spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. If the spleen is enlarged or diseased, it may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia.\n                \nExamples of inherited conditions that can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells include sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells.\n                \nHemolytic anemia is another example of a condition in which your body destroys too many red blood cells. Inherited or acquired conditions or factors can cause hemolytic anemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Anemia? ?",
            "answer": "Anemia is a common condition. It occurs in all age, racial, and ethnic groups. Both men and women can have anemia. However, women of childbearing age are at higher risk for the condition because of blood loss from menstruation.\n                \nAnemia can develop during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid (folate) and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman's blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia.\n                \nDuring the first year of life, some babies are at risk for anemia because of iron deficiency. At-risk infants include those who are born too early and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron. These infants can develop iron deficiency by 6 months of age.\n                \nInfants between 1 and 2 years of age also are at risk for anemia. They may not get enough iron in their diets, especially if they drink a lot of cow's milk. Cow's milk is low in the iron needed for growth.\n                \nDrinking too much cow's milk may keep an infant or toddler from eating enough iron-rich foods or absorbing enough iron from foods.\n                \nOlder adults also are at increased risk for anemia. Researchers continue to study how the condition affects older adults. Many of these people have other medical conditions as well.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nFactors that raise your risk for anemia include:\n                \nA diet that is low in iron, vitamins, or minerals\n                \nBlood loss from surgery or an injury\n                \nLong-term or serious illnesses, such as kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease), liver disease, heart failure, and thyroid disease\n                \nLong-term infections\n                \nA family history of inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia"

        {
            "question": "What are the symptoms of Anemia ?",
            "answer": "The most common symptom of anemia is fatigue (feeling tired or weak). If you have anemia, you may find it hard to find the energy to do normal activities.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of anemia include:\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nDizziness\n                \nHeadache\n                \nColdness in the hands and feet\n                \nPale skin\n                \nChest pain\n                \nThese signs and symptoms can occur because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood through your body.\n                \nMild to moderate anemia may cause very mild symptoms or none at all.\n                \nComplications of Anemia\n                \nSome people who have anemia may have arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Over time, arrhythmias can damage your heart and possibly lead to heart failure.\n                \nAnemia also can damage other organs in your body because your blood can't get enough oxygen to them.\n                \nAnemia can weaken people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS. This can make their treatments not work as well.\n                \nAnemia also can cause many other health problems. People who have kidney disease and anemia are more likely to have heart problems. With some types of anemia, too little fluid intake or too much loss of fluid in the blood and body can occur. Severe loss of fluid can be life threatening."

        {
            "question": "How to diagnose Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from tests and procedures.\n                \nBecause anemia doesn't always cause symptoms, your doctor may find out you have it while checking for another condition.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether you have any of the common signs or symptoms of anemia. He or she also may ask whether you've had an illness or condition that could cause anemia.\n                \nLet your doctor know about any medicines you take, what you typically eat (your diet), and whether you have family members who have anemia or a history of it.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to find out how severe your anemia is and to check for possible causes. He or she may:\n                \nListen to your heart for a rapid or irregular heartbeat\n                \nListen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing\n                \nFeel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen\n                \nYour doctor also may do a pelvic or rectal exam to check for common sources of blood loss.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYou may have various blood tests and other tests or procedures to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\n                \nThe test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\n                \nThe normal range of these levels might be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results might be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\n                \nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells and a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal.\n                \nOther Tests and Procedures\n                \nIf the CBC results show that you have anemia, you may need other tests, such as:\n                \nHemoglobin electrophoresis (e-lek-tro-FOR-e-sis). This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. The test can help diagnose the type of anemia you have.\n                \nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate.\n                \nTests for the level of iron in your blood and body. These tests include serum iron and serum ferritin tests. Transferrin level and total iron-binding capacity tests also measure iron levels.\n                \nBecause anemia has many causes, you also might be tested for conditions such as kidney failure, lead poisoning (in children), and vitamin deficiencies (lack of vitamins, such as B12 and folic acid).\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have anemia due to internal bleeding, he or she may suggest several tests to look for the source of the bleeding. A test to check the stool for blood might be done in your doctor's office or at home. Your doctor can give you a kit to help you get a sample at home. He or she will tell you to bring the sample back to the office or send it to a laboratory.\n                \nIf blood is found in the stool, you may have other tests to find the source of the bleeding. One such test is endoscopy (en-DOS-ko-pe). For this test, a tube with a tiny camera is used to view the lining of the digestive tract.\n                \nYour doctor also may want to do bone marrow tests. These tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes or supplements, medicines, procedures, or surgery to treat blood loss.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nThe goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.)\n                \nAnother goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia.\n                \nDietary Changes and Supplements\n                \nLow levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia. These low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions.\n                \nTo raise your vitamin or iron level, your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements. Common vitamin supplements are vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate). Vitamin C sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron.\n                \nIron\n                \nYour body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods. To treat your anemia, your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat (such as beef or liver), as well as chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish.\n                \nNonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:\n                \nSpinach and other dark green leafy vegetables\n                \nTofu\n                \nPeas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas\n                \nDried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots\n                \nPrune juice\n                \nIron-fortified cereals and breads\n                \nYou can look at the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.\n                \nIron also is available as a supplement. It's usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron.\n                \nDoctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants, infants and young children who drink a lot of cow's milk, and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron.\n                \nLarge amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes.\n                \nVitamin B12\n                \nLow levels of vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia. This type of anemia often is treated with vitamin B12 supplements.\n                \nGood food sources of vitamin B12 include:\n                \nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\n                \nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\n                \nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\n                \nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\n                \nFolic Acid\n                \nFolic acid (folate) is a form of vitamin B that's found in foods. Your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells. Folic acid also is very important for pregnant women. It helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus.\n                \nGood sources of folic acid include:\n                \nBread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid\n                \nSpinach and other dark green leafy vegetables\n                \nBlack-eyed peas and dried beans\n                \nBeef liver\n                \nEggs\n                \nBananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices\n                \nVitamin C\n                \nVitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitaminC than canned ones.\n                \nIf you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. This fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.\n                \nOther fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.\n                \nVegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia. Some of these medicines include:\n                \nAntibiotics to treat infections.\n                \nHormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women.\n                \nA man-made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells. This hormone has some risks.

Chelation therapy is used mainly in children. This is because children who have iron-deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning.\n                \nProcedures\n                \nIf your anemia is severe, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. Procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants.\n                \nBlood Transfusion\n                \nA blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They develop into red and white blood cells and platelets.\n                \nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIf you have serious or life-threatening bleeding that's causing anemia, you may need surgery. For example, you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer.\n                \nIf your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate, you may need to have your spleen removed. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia."

This condition involves inflammation of the blood vessels.\n                \nIn Kawasaki disease, the walls of the blood vessels throughout the body become inflamed. The disease can affect any type of blood vessel in the body, including the arteries, veins, and capillaries.\n                \nSometimes Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart. As a result, some children who have Kawasaki disease may develop serious heart problems.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe cause of Kawasaki disease isn't known.

However, no specific virus or infection has been found, and the role of genetics isn't known.\n                \nThe disease can't be passed from one child to another. Your child won't get it from close contact with a child who has the disease. Also, if your child has the disease, he or she can't pass it to another child.\n                \nKawasaki disease affects children of all races and ages and both genders.

Pediatricians are doctors who specialize in treating children.\n                \nIf the disease has affected your child's coronary (heart) arteries, a pediatric cardiologist will confirm the diagnosis and give ongoing treatment. Pediatric cardiologists treat children who have heart problems.\n                \nOther specialists also may be involved in treating children who have Kawasaki disease.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nThe doctor will check your child for the classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n                \nThe doctor will rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. These diseases include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scarlet fever, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\n                \nGenerally, your child will be diagnosed with Kawasaki disease if he or she has a fever that lasts longer than 5 days plus four other classic signs or symptoms of the disease.\n                \nHowever, not all children have classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease. Tests and procedures can help confirm whether a child has the disease.\n                \nTests and Procedures\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nIf the doctor thinks that your child has Kawasaki disease, he or she will likely recommendechocardiography(EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo. This painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart and coronary arteries.\n                \nEcho also can help show the disease's effects over time, if any, on your child's coronary arteries. Often, the disease's effects on the coronary arteries don't show up until the second or third week after the first symptoms appear. Thus, this test is done regularly after the diagnosis.\n                \nSome children who have Kawasaki disease don't have the classic signs and symptoms of the acute phase. Doctors may not diagnose these children until 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of the disease. This is when another common sign of Kawasaki disease occurspeeling of the skin on the fingers and toes.\n                \nIf your child is diagnosed at this point, he or she will likely need echo right away to see whether the disease has affected the coronary arteries.\n                \nOther Diagnostic Tests\n                \nDoctors also use other tests to help diagnose Kawasaki disease, such as:\n                \nBlood tests. The results from blood tests can show whether the body's blood vessels are inflamed.\n                \nChest x ray. This painless test creates pictures of structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. A chest x ray can show whether Kawasaki disease has affected the heart.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG can show whether Kawasaki disease has affected the heart."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Kawasaki Disease ?",
            "answer": "Medicines are the main treatment for Kawasaki disease. Rarely, children whose coronary (heart) arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery.\n                \nThe goals of treatment include:\n                \nReducing fever and inflammation to improve symptoms\n                \nPreventing the disease from affecting the coronary arteries\n                \nInitial Treatment\n                \nKawasaki disease can cause serious health problems. Thus, your child will likely be treated in a hospital, at least for the early part of treatment.\n                \nThe standard treatment during the disease's acute phase is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine that's injected into a vein.\n                \nMost children who receive these treatments improve greatly within 24 hours. For a small number of children, fever remains. These children may need a second round of immune globulin.\n                \nAt the start of treatment, your child will receive high doses of aspirin. As soon as his or her fever goes away, a low dose of aspirin is given. The low dose helps prevent blood clots, which can form in the inflamed small arteries.\n                \nMost children treated for Kawasaki disease fully recover from the acute phase and don't need any further treatment. They should, however, follow a healthy diet and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. Taking these steps can help lower the risk of future heart disease. (Following a healthy lifestyle is advised for all children, not just those who have Kawasaki disease.)\n                \nChildren who have had immune globulin should wait 11 months before having the measles and chicken pox vaccines. Immune globulin can prevent those vaccines from working well.\n                \nLong-Term Care and Treatment\n                \nIf Kawasaki disease has affected your child's coronary arteries, he or she will need ongoing care and treatment.\n                \nIt's best if a pediatric cardiologist provides this care to reduce the risk of severe heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have heart problems.\n                \nMedicines and Tests\n                \nWhen Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, they may expand and twist. If this happens, your child's doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medicines (for example, warfarin). These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the affected coronary arteries.\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines usually are stopped after the coronary arteries heal. Healing may occur about 18 months after the acute phase of the disease.\n                \nIn a small number of children, the coronary arteries don't heal. These children likely will need routine tests, such as:\n                \nEchocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\n                \nStress test. This test provides information about how the heart works during physical activity or stress.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nRarely, a child who has Kawasaki disease may needcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Doctors use this procedure to diagnose and treat some heart conditions.\n                \nA flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to the heart. Through the catheter, doctors can perform tests and treatments on the heart.\n                \nVery rarely, a child may need to have other procedures or surgery if inflammation narrows his or her coronary arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart.\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) may be used.\n                \nCoronary angioplasty restores blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. A thin tube with a balloon on the end is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or groin. The tube is threaded to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Then, the balloon is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow.\n                \nA stent (small mesh tube) may be placed in the coronary artery during angioplasty. This device helps support the narrowed or weakened artery. A stent can improve blood flow and prevent the artery from bursting.\n                \nRarely, a child may need to have CABG. This surgery is used to treat blocked coronary arteries. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery.\n                \nThe grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the coronary artery. This improves blood flow to the heart."

            "answer": "Your doctor or your child's doctor will diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) based on signs and symptoms and test results.\n                \nIf your primary care doctor thinks that you may have PCD or another lung disorder, he or she may refer you to a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases and conditions.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nYour doctor will look for signs and symptoms that point to PCD, such as:\n                \nRespiratory distress (breathing problems) at birth\n                \nChronic sinus, middle ear, and/or lung infections\n                \nSitus inversus (internal organs in positions opposite of what is normal)\n                \nFor more information, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia?\"\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you have a family history of PCD. PCD is an inherited disease. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. A family history of PCD suggests an increased risk for the disease.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nIf the doctor thinks that you or your child might have PCD, he or she may recommend tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n                \nGenetic Testing\n                \nResearchers have found many gene defects associated with PCD. Genetic testing can show whether you have faulty genes linked to the disease.\n                \nGenetic testing is done using a blood sample. The sample is taken from a vein in your body using a needle. The blood sample is checked at a special genetic testing laboratory (lab).\n                \nElectron Microscopy\n                \nDoctors can use a special microscope, called an electron microscope, to look at samples of your airway cilia. This test can show whether your cilia are faulty.\n                \nAn ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or a pulmonologist (lung specialist) will take samples of your cilia. He or she will brush the inside of your nose or remove some cells from your airways.\n                \nThe doctor will send the samples to a lab. There, a pathologist will look at them under an electron microscope. (A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.)\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nSometimes doctors use one or more of the following tests to help diagnose PCD. These tests are less complex than genetic testing and electron microscopy, and they can be done in a doctor's office.\n                \nHowever, these tests don't give a final diagnosis. Based on the test results, doctors may recommend the more complex tests.\n                \nVideo microscopy. For this test, a pulmonologist brushes the inside of your nose to get a sample of cilia. Then, he or she looks at the cilia under a microscope to see how they move. Abnormal movement of the cilia may be a sign of PCD.\n                \nRadiolabeled particles. For this test, you breathe in tiny particles that have a small amount of radiation attached to them. When you breathe out, your doctor will test how well your cilia can move the particles.\n                \nIf you breathe out a smaller than normal number of particles, your cilia may not be working well. This could be a sign of PCD.\n                \nNasal nitric oxide. This test measures the level of nitric oxide (a gas) when you breathe out. In people who have PCD, the level of nitric oxide is very low compared with normal levels. Doctors don't know why people who have PCD breathe out such low levels of nitric oxide.\n                \nSemen analysis. This test is used for adult men. In men, PCD can affect cilia-like structures that help sperm cells move. As a result, men who have PCD may have fertility problems. (\"Fertility\" refers to the ability to have children.)\n                \nFor this test, a sample of semen is checked under a microscope. Abnormal sperm may be a sign of PCD.\n                \nTests for other conditions. Your doctor also might want to do tests to rule out diseases and disorders that have symptoms similar to those of PCD. For example, you may have tests to rule out cystic fibrosis or immune disorders."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ?",
            "answer": "Unfortunately, no treatment is available yet to fix faulty airway cilia. (Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways.) Thus, treatment for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) focuses on which symptoms and complications you have.\n                \nThe main goals of treating PCD are to:\n                \nControl and treat lung, sinus, and ear infections\n                \nRemove trapped mucus from the lungs and airways\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nMany doctors may help care for someone who has PCD. For example, a neonatologist may suspect PCD or another lung disorder if a newborn has breathing problems at birth. A neonatologist is a doctor who specializes in treating newborns.\n                \nA pediatrician may suspect PCD if a child has chronic (ongoing) sinus, ear, and/or lung infections. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children. This type of doctor provides children with ongoing care from an early age and treats conditions such as ear infections and breathing problems.\n                \nAn otolaryngologist also may help diagnose and treat PCD. This type of doctor treats ear, nose, and throat disorders and also is called an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. If a child has chronic sinus or ear infections, an ENT specialist may be involved in the child's care.\n                \nA pulmonologist may help diagnose or treat lung problems related to PCD. This type of doctor specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases and conditions. Most people who have PCD have lung problems at some point in their lives.\n                \nA pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. This type of doctor may help diagnose PCD by looking at cilia under a microscope.\n                \nA pathologist also may look at mucus samples to see what types of bacteria are causing infections. This information can help your doctor decide which treatments to prescribe.\n                \nTreatments for Breathing and Lung Problems\n                \nStandard treatments for breathing and lung problems in people who have PCD are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines.\n                \nOne of the main goals of these treatments is to get you to cough. Coughing clears mucus from the airways, which is important for people who have PCD. For this reason, your doctor also may advise you to avoid medicines that suppress coughing.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.\n                \nYou might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been made to help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves. The airwaves force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small hand-held device that you breathe out through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations to help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.\n                \nBreathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.\n                \nExercise\n                \nAerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder helps loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about what types and amounts of exercise are safe for you or your child.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have PCD, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, bronchodilators, or anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines help treat lung infections, open up the airways, and reduce swelling.\n                \nAntibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nOral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given IV antibiotics through a tube inserted into a vein.\n                \nTo help decide which antibiotics you need, your doctor may send mucus samples to a pathologist. The pathologist will try to find out which bacteria are causing the infection.\n                \nBronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. You inhale these medicines. Often, they're taken just before CPT to help clear mucus from your lungs. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.\n                \nAnti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways that's caused by ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.\n                \nTreatments for Sinus and Ear Infections\n                \nTo treat infections, your doctor may recommend saline nasal washes and anti-inflammatory nasal spray. If these treatments aren't enough, you may need medicines, such as antibiotics. If antibiotics don't work, surgery may be an option.\n                \nTympanostomy (tim-pan-OS-toe-me) is a procedure in which small tubes are inserted into the eardrums to help drain mucus from the ears. This procedure may help children who have hearing problems caused by PCD.\n                \nNasal or sinus surgery may help drain the sinuses and provide short-term relief of symptoms. However, the long-term benefits of this treatment are unclear.\n                \nTreatments for Advanced Lung Disease\n                \nPeople who have PCD may develop a serious lung condition called bronchiectasis. This condition often is treated with medicines, hydration (drinking plenty of fluids), and CPT.\n                \nIf bronchiectasis severely affects part of your lung, surgery may be used to remove that area of lung.\n                \nIn very rare cases, if other treatments haven't worked, lung transplant may be an option for severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor."

            "question": "What is (are) Marfan Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Marfan syndrome is a condition in which your body's connective tissue is abnormal. Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body. It also helps control how your body grows and develops.\n                \nMarfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart and blood vessels, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord. Because the condition affects many parts of the body, it can cause many complications. Sometimes the complications are life threatening.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder. A mutation, or change, in the gene that controls how the body makes fibrillin causes Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is a protein that plays a major role in your body's connective tissue.\n                \nMost people who have Marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents. If you have Marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children.\n                \nIn about 1 in 4 cases, the mutation that causes Marfan syndrome is not inherited. Thus, the affected person is the first in his or her family to have the condition.\n                \nMarfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body. This can lead to signs, or traits, such as:\n                \nA tall, thin build.\n                \nLong arms, legs, fingers, and toes and flexible joints.\n                \nA spine that curves to one side. This condition is called scoliosis (sko-le-O-sis).\n                \nA chest that sinks in or sticks out. These conditions are called pectus excavatum (eks-ka-VA-tum) and pectus carinatum (ka-ri-NA-tum), respectively.\n                \nTeeth that are too crowded.\n                \nFlat feet.\n                \nMarfan syndrome traits vary from person to person, even in the same family. Some people who have the condition have many traits, while others have few.\n                \nThe most serious complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels. Marfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. In Marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. This condition is called aortic dilation (di-LA-shun) or aortic aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\n                \nIf the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear or burst and leak blood. This condition is called aortic dissection. It's very serious and can lead to severe heart problems or even death.\n                \nMarfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies. Limiting certain activities, or changing how you do them, may help reduce the risks to the aorta, eyes, and joints.\n                \nThe type of treatment you receive depends on how the condition is affecting your body.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAbout 1 out of every 5,000 people in the United States has Marfan syndrome. Men, women, children, and people of all races can have the condition.\n                \nAdvances have been made in the early diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome. It's now possible for people who have the condition to live longer and enjoy a good quality of life. Many people who have Marfan syndrome and are properly diagnosed and treated may live an average lifespan.\n                \nResearchers continue to study the condition and look for better treatments."

As a result, the signs and symptoms of the disorder vary from person to person, even in the same family.\n                \nMarfan complications also vary, depending on how the condition affects your body. Marfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord.

Stretch marks usually appear on the lower back, buttocks, shoulders, breasts, thighs, and abdomen.\n                \nNot everyone who has these traits has Marfan syndrome. Some of these traits also are signs of other connective tissue disorders.\n                \nComplications of Marfan Syndrome\n                \nHeart and Blood Vessel Complications\n                \nThe most serious complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels.\n                \nMarfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. In Marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. This condition is called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm.\n                \nIf the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear and leak blood. This condition, called aortic dissection, can lead to severe heart problems or even death.\n                \nAortic dissection can cause severe pain in either the front or back of the chest or abdomen. The pain can travel upward or downward. If you have symptoms of aortic dissection, call 911.\n                \nMarfan syndrome also can cause problems with the heart's mitral (MI-trul) valve. This valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart. Marfan syndrome can lead to mitral valve prolapse (MVP).\n                \nMVP is a condition in which the flaps of the mitral valve are floppy and don't close tightly. MVP can cause shortness of breath, palpitations (pal-pi-TA-shuns), chest pain, and other symptoms.\n                \nIf you have MVP, your doctor may hear a heart murmur if he or she listens to your heart with a stethoscope. A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat.\n                \nEye Complications\n                \nMarfan syndrome can cause many eye problems. A common problem in Marfan syndrome is a dislocated lens in one or both of the eyes. In this condition, the lens (the part of the eye that helps focus light) shifts up, down, or to the side. This can affect your eyesight. A dislocated lens often is the first sign that someone has Marfan syndrome.\n                \nOther eye complications of Marfan syndrome include nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and early cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens). A detached retina also can occur.\n                \nNervous System Complications\n                \nFluid surrounds your brain and spinal cord. A substance called dura covers the fluid. In Marfan syndrome, the dura can stretch and grow weak.\n                \nThis condition, called dural ectasia (ek-TA-ze-ah), can occur in people who have Marfan syndrome as they grow older. Eventually, the bones of the spine may wear away.\n                \nSymptoms of this condition are lower back pain, abdominal pain, headache, and numbness in the legs.\n                \nLung Complications\n                \nMarfan syndrome can cause sudden pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks), or collapsed lung. In this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and chest wall. If enough air or gas builds up, a lung can collapse.\n                \nThe most common symptoms of a collapsed lung are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath.\n                \nConditions such as scoliosis (a curved spine) and pectus excavatum (a chest that sinks in) can prevent the lungs from expanding fully. This can cause breathing problems. Marfan syndrome also can cause changes in the lung tissue, and it can lead to early emphysema (em-fi-SE-ma).\n                \nMarfan syndrome also has been linked to sleep apnea. In people who have Marfan syndrome, the shape of the face, oral cavity, or teeth may increase the risk of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nBreathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound."

            "question": "How to diagnose Marfan Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose Marfan syndrome based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. He or she also will consult a set of guidelines called Ghent criteria, which are used to diagnose Marfan syndrome.\n                \nMarfan syndrome can be hard to diagnose. This is because its signs, or traits, are the same as or similar to the signs of other connective tissue disorders.\n                \nIf you're diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, all of your first-degree relatives (for example, parents, siblings, and children) also should be checked for the disorder. This is because, even in families, the outward traits of Marfan syndrome may vary quite a bit.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nYour family doctor or another type of doctor, such as an orthopedist (bone specialist), may notice certain traits that suggest Marfan syndrome.\n                \nIf so, your doctor will likely refer you to a geneticist or cardiologist. A geneticist is hereditary disease expert. A cardiologist is a heart specialist. These two types of specialists often have the most experience working with people who have Marfan syndrome.\n                \nA geneticist will ask for medical information about you and your family. He or she will examine you and perhaps other members of your family. The geneticist also will coordinate your visits with other doctors, including a cardiologist, an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), and an orthopedist.\n                \nAfter reviewing the medical findings, the geneticist will determine whether you have Marfan syndrome.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will ask about your medical history and your family's medical history. For example, your doctor may ask whether:\n                \nYou've had heart disease, eye problems, or problems with your spine. These complications are common in people who have Marfan syndrome.\n                \nYou have shortness of breath, palpitations, or chest pain. These are common symptoms of heart or lung problems linked to Marfan syndrome.\n                \nAny of your family members have Marfan syndrome, have died from heart problems, or have died suddenly.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for Marfan syndrome traits. For example, he or she may check the curve of your spine and the shape of your feet. Your doctor also will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose Marfan syndrome.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nThis test shows the size and shape of your heart and the diameter of your aorta or other blood vessels. (The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your body.) Echo also shows how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\n                \nFor people who have Marfan syndrome, echo mainly is used to check the heart's valves and aorta.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography Scans\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses radio waves and magnets to create detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Computed tomography (CT) uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your organs.\n                \nMRI and CT scans are used to check your heart valves and aorta. These scans also are used to check for dural ectasia, a nervous system complication of Marfan syndrome.\n                \nSlit-Lamp Exam\n                \nFor this test, an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) will use a microscope with a light to check your eyes. A slit-lamp exam can find out whether you have a dislocated lens, cataracts, or a detached retina.\n                \nGenetic Testing\n                \nIn general, genetic testing involves blood tests to detect changes in genes. However, because many different genetic changes can cause Marfan syndrome, no single blood test can diagnose the condition.\n                \nGhent Criteria\n                \nBecause no single test can diagnose Marfan syndrome, doctors use a set of guidelines called Ghent criteria to help diagnose the condition. The Ghent criteria are divided into major criteria and minor criteria. Sometimes genetic testing is part of this evaluation.\n                \nMajor criteria include traits that are common in people who have Marfan syndrome. Minor criteria include traits that are common in many people. Doctors use a scoring system based on the number and type of Ghent criteria present to diagnose Marfan syndrome.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about which traits you have and your likelihood of having Marfan syndrome."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Marfan Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Marfan syndrome has no cure. However, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early.\n                \nMarfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms.\n                \nHeart Treatments\n                \nAortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to Marfan syndrome. In this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak.\n                \nMedicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. Surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears.\n                \nIf you have Marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nBeta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. These medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation.\n                \nSome people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). If side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. Both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta.\n                \nStudies suggest that blocking a protein called TGF-beta may help prevent some of the effects of Marfan syndrome. Research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions.\n                \nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have Marfan syndrome. The study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIf your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). To prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta.\n                \nSurgery may involve:\n                \nA composite valve graft. For this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. The aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. A man-made valve replaces the original valve.\n                \nAortic valve-sparing surgery. If your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. For this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. Your aortic valve is left in place.\n                \nAfter aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. For example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or \"blood thinners.\"\n                \nBlood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. You'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. If you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes.\n                \nIf you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. Your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis.\n                \nYour doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery.\n                \nAfter surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans to check your aorta.\n                \nCardiac MRI is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Cardiac CT is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart.\n                \nBone and Joint Treatments\n                \nIf you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. Severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery.\n                \nSome people who have Marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. This surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart.\n                \nEye Treatments\n                \nMarfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens).\n                \nGlasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. Sometimes surgery is needed.\n                \nNervous System Treatments\n                \nMarfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. In this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. This can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. Dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines.\n                \nLung Treatments\n                \nMarfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. In this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall.\n                \nIf the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. However, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. Sometimes surgery is needed."

            "question": "What is (are) Pernicious Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Pernicious anemia (per-NISH-us uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which the body can't make enough healthy red blood cells because it doesn't have enough vitamin B12.\n                \nVitamin B12 is a nutrient found in some foods. The body needs this nutrient to make healthy red blood cells and to keep its nervous system working properly.\n                \nPeople who have pernicious anemia can't absorb enough vitamin B12 from food. This is because they lack intrinsic (in-TRIN-sik) factor, a protein made in the stomach. A lack of this protein leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.\n                \nOther conditions and factors also can cause vitamin B12 deficiency. Examples include infections, surgery, medicines, and diet. Technically, the term \"pernicious anemia\" refers to vitamin B12 deficiency due to a lack of intrinsic factor. Often though, vitamin B12 deficiency due to other causes also is called pernicious anemia.\n                \nThis article discusses pernicious anemia due to a lack of intrinsic factor and other causes.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPernicious anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. In pernicious anemia, the body can't make enough healthy red blood cells because it doesn't have enough vitamin B12.\n                \nWithout enough vitamin B12, your red blood cells don't divide normally and are too large. They may have trouble getting out of the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones where blood cells are made.\n                \nWithout enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body, you may feel tired and weak. Severe or long-lasting pernicious anemia can damage the heart, brain, and other organs in the body.\n                \nPernicious anemia also can cause other problems, such as nerve damage, neurological problems (such as memory loss), and digestive tract problems. People who have pernicious anemia also may be at higher risk for weakened bone strength and stomach cancer.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe term pernicious means deadly. The condition is called pernicious anemia because it often was fatal in the past, before vitamin B12 treatments were available. Now, pernicious anemia usually is easy to treat with vitamin B12 pills or shots.\n                \nWith ongoing care and proper treatment, most people who have pernicious anemia can recover, feel well, and live normal lives.\n                \nWithout treatment, pernicious anemia can lead to serious problems with the heart, nerves, and other parts of the body. Some of these problems may be permanent."

            "question": "What causes Pernicious Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes, such as infections, surgery, medicines, or diet.\n                \nLack of Intrinsic Factor\n                \nIntrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach. It helps your body absorb vitamin B12. In some people, an autoimmune response causes a lack of intrinsic factor.\n                \nAn autoimmune response occurs if the bodys immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\n                \nIn pernicious anemia, the body makes antibodies that attack and destroy the parietal (pa-RI-eh-tal) cells. These cells line the stomach and make intrinsic factor. Why this autoimmune response occurs isn't known.\n                \nAs a result of this attack, the stomach stops making intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, your body can't move vitamin B12 through the small intestine, where it's absorbed. This leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.\n                \nA lack of intrinsic factor also can occur if you've had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. This type of surgery reduces the number of parietal cells available to make intrinsic factor.\n                \nRarely, children are born with an inherited disorder that prevents their bodies from making intrinsic factor. This disorder is called congenital pernicious anemia.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nPernicious anemia also has other causes, besides a lack of intrinsic factor. Malabsorption in the small intestine and a diet lacking vitamin B12 both can lead to pernicious anemia.\n                \nMalabsorption in the Small Intestine\n                \nSometimes pernicious anemia occurs because the body's small intestine can't properly absorb vitamin B12. This may be the result of:\n                \nToo many of the wrong kind of bacteria in the small intestine. This is a common cause of pernicious anemia in older adults. The bacteria use up the available vitamin B12 before the small intestine can absorb it.\n                \nDiseases that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption. One example is celiac disease. This is a genetic disorder in which your body can't tolerate a protein called gluten. Another example is Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. HIV also may interfere with vitamin B12 absorption.\n                \nCertain medicines that alter bacterial growth or prevent the small intestine from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include antibiotics and certain diabetes and seizure medicines.\n                \nSurgical removal of part or all of the small intestine.\n                \nA tapeworm infection. The tapeworm feeds off of the vitamin B12. Eating undercooked, infected fish may cause this type of infection.\n                \nDiet Lacking Vitamin B12\n                \nSome people get pernicious anemia because they don't have enough vitamin B12 in their diets. This cause of pernicious anemia is less common than other causes.\n                \nGood food sources of vitamin B12 include:\n                \nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\n                \nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\n                \nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\n                \nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\n                \nStrict vegetarians who don't eat any animal or dairy products and don't take a vitamin B12 supplement are at risk for pernicious anemia.\n                \nBreastfed infants of strict vegetarian mothers also are at risk for pernicious anemia. These infants can develop anemia within months of being born. This is because they haven't had enough time to store vitamin B12 in their bodies. Doctors treat these infants with vitamin B12 supplements.\n                \nOther groups, such as the elderly and people who suffer from alcoholism, also may be at risk for pernicious anemia. These people may not get the proper nutrients in their diets."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Pernicious Anemia? ?",

This is mainly due to a lack of stomach acid and intrinsic factor, which prevents the small intestine from absorbing vitamin B12. As people grow older, they tend to make less stomach acid.\n                \nPernicious anemia also can occur in younger people and other populations. You're at higher risk for pernicious anemia if you:\n                \nHave a family history of the condition.\n                \nHave had part or all of your stomach surgically removed.

Without enough vitamin B12, your body can't make enough healthy red blood cells, which causes anemia.\n                \nSome of the signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia apply to all types of anemia. Other signs and symptoms are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Anemia\n                \nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesnt have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts.\n                \nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale or yellowish skin, and chest pain.\n                \nA lack of red blood cells also means that your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n                \nVitamin B12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage. This can cause tingling and numbness in your hands and feet, muscle weakness, and loss of reflexes. You also may feel unsteady, lose your balance, and have trouble walking. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause weakened bones and may lead to hip fractures.\n                \nSevere vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological problems, such as confusion, dementia, depression, and memory loss.\n                \nOther symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency involve the digestive tract. These symptoms include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting, heartburn, abdominal bloating and gas, constipation or diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. An enlarged liver is another symptom.\n                \nA smooth, thick, red tongue also is a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anemia.\n                \nInfants who have vitamin B12 deficiency may have poor reflexes or unusual movements, such as face tremors. They may have trouble feeding due to tongue and throat problems. They also may be irritable. If vitamin B12 deficiency isn't treated, these infants may have permanent growth problems."

He or she also will want to find out the severity of the condition, so it can be properly treated.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctorssuch as family doctors, internists, and pediatricians (doctors who treat children)often diagnose and treat pernicious anemia. Other kinds of doctors also may be involved, including:\n                \nA neurologist (nervous system specialist)\n                \nA cardiologist (heart specialist)\n                \nA hematologist (blood disease specialist)\n                \nA gastroenterologist (digestive tract specialist)\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms. He or she also may ask:\n                \nWhether you've had any stomach or intestinal surgeries\n                \nWhether you have any digestive disorders, such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease\n                \nAbout your diet and any medicines you take\n                \nWhether you have a family history of anemia or pernicious anemia\n                \nWhether you have a family history of autoimmune disorders (such as Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, or vitiligo). Research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia that's caused by an autoimmune response.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor may check for pale or yellowish skin and an enlarged liver. He or she may listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats or a heart murmur.\n                \nYour doctor also may check for signs of nerve damage. He or she may want to see how well your muscles, eyes, senses, and reflexes work. Your doctor may ask questions or do tests to check your mental status, coordination, and ability to walk.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nBlood tests and procedures can help diagnose pernicious anemia and find out what's causing it.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose many types of anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). This test measures many parts of your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a vein (usually in your arm) using a needle.\n                \nA CBC checks your hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\n                \nThe normal range of these levels may be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets) in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\n                \nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. MCV can be a clue as to what's causing your anemia. In pernicious anemia, the red blood cells tend to be larger than normal.\n                \nOther Blood Tests\n                \nIf the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have.\n                \nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have pernicious anemia have low reticulocyte counts.\n                \nSerum folate, iron, and iron-binding capacity tests also can help show whether you have pernicious anemia or another type of anemia.\n                \nAnother common test, called the Combined Binding Luminescence Test, sometimes gives false results. Scientists are working to develop a more reliable test.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other blood tests to check:\n                \nYour vitamin B12 level. A low level of vitamin B12 in the blood indicates pernicious anemia. However, a falsely normal or high value of vitamin B12 in the blood may occur if antibodies interfere with the test.\n                \nYour homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. High levels of these substances in your body are a sign of pernicious anemia.\n                \nFor intrinsic factor antibodies and parietal cell antibodies. These antibodies also are a sign of pernicious anemia.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough red blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nFor aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. For a biopsy, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle. The samples are then examined under a microscope.\n                \nIn pernicious anemia, the bone marrow cells that turn into blood cells are larger than normal."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nSleep apnea (AP-ne-ah) is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nBreathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.\n                \nSleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.\n                \nAs a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.\n                \nOverview\n                \nSleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.\n                \nMost people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.\n                \nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.\n                \nWhen you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea.\n                \nThe animation below shows how obstructive sleep apnea occurs.

This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods.\n                \nCentral sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines.\n                \nCentral sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea.\n                \nThis article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nUntreated sleep apnea can:\n                \nIncrease the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes\n                \nIncrease the risk of, or worsen, heart failure\n                \nMake arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely\n                \nIncrease the chance of having work-related or driving accidents\n                \nSleep apnea is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people."

            "question": "What causes Sleep Apnea ?",
            "answer": "When you're awake, throat muscles help keep your airway stiff and open so air can flow into your lungs. When you sleep, these muscles relax, which narrows your throat.\n                \nNormally, this narrowing doesnt prevent air from flowing into and out of your lungs. But if you have sleep apnea, your airway can become partially or fully blocked because:\n                \nYour throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal.\n                \nYour tongue and tonsils (tissue masses in the back of your mouth) are large compared with the opening into your windpipe.\n                \nYou're overweight. The extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe. This narrows the inside of the windpipe, which makes it harder to keep open.\n                \nThe shape of your head and neck (bony structure) may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area.\n                \nThe aging process limits your brain signals' ability to keep your throat muscles stiff during sleep. Thus, your airway is more likely to narrow or collapse.\n                \nNot enough air flows into your lungs if your airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep. As a result, loud snoring and a drop in your blood oxygen level can occur.\n                \nIf the oxygen drops to a dangerous level, it triggers your brain to disturb your sleep. This helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. Normal breathing then starts again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.\n                \nFrequent drops in your blood oxygen level and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise your heart rate and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). The hormones also can raise your risk for, or worsen, heart failure.\n                \nUntreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how your body uses energy. These changes increase your risk for obesity and diabetes."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Sleep Apnea? ?",
            "answer": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition. About half of the people who have this condition are overweight.\n                \nMen are more likely than women to have sleep apnea. Although the condition can occur at any age, the risk increases as you get older. A family history of sleep apnea also increases your risk for the condition.\n                \nPeople who have small airways in their noses, throats, or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea. Small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion.\n                \nSmall children might have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats. Enlarged tonsil tissues raise a childs risk for sleep apnea. Overweight children also might be at increased risk for sleep apnea.\n                \nAbout half of the people who have sleep apnea also have high blood pressure. Sleep apnea also is linked to smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and risk factors for stroke and heart failure.\n                \nRace and ethnicity might play a role in the risk of developing sleep apnea. However, more research is needed."

            "answer": "Major Signs and Symptoms\n                \nOne of the most common signs of obstructive sleep apnea is loud and chronic (ongoing) snoring. Pauses may occur in the snoring. Choking or gasping may follow the pauses.\n                \nThe snoring usually is loudest when you sleep on your back; it might be less noisy when you turn on your side. You might not snore every night. Over time, however, the snoring can happen more often and get louder.\n                \nYou're asleep when the snoring or gasping happens. You likely won't know that you're having problems breathing or be able to judge how severe the problem is. A family member or bed partner often will notice these problems before you do.\n                \nNot everyone who snores has sleep apnea.\n                \nAnother common sign of sleep apnea is fighting sleepiness during the day, at work, or while driving. You may find yourself rapidly falling asleep during the quiet moments of the day when you're not active. Even if you don't have daytime sleepiness, talk with your doctor if you have problems breathing during sleep.\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms\n                \nOthers signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include:\n                \nMorning headaches\n                \nMemory or learning problems and not being able to concentrate\n                \nFeeling irritable, depressed, or having mood swings or personality changes\n                \nWaking up frequently to urinate\n                \nDry mouth or sore throat when you wake up\n                \nIn children, sleep apnea can cause hyperactivity, poor school performance, and angry or hostile behavior. Children who have sleep apnea also may breathe through their mouths instead of their noses during the day."

            "question": "How to diagnose Sleep Apnea ?",
            "answer": "Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results. Your primary care doctor may evaluate your symptoms first. He or she will then decide whether you need to see a sleep specialist.\n                \nSleep specialists are doctors who diagnose and treat people who have sleep problems. Examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nIf you think you have a sleep problem, consider keeping a sleep diary for 1 to 2 weeks. Bring the diary with you to your next medical appointment.\n                \nWrite down when you go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. Also write down how much you sleep each night, how alert and rested you feel in the morning, and how sleepy you feel at various times during the day. This information can help your doctor figure out whether you have a sleep disorder.\n                \nYou can find a sample sleep diary in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nAt your appointment, your doctor will ask you questions about how you sleep and how you function during the day.\n                \nYour doctor also will want to know how loudly and often you snore or make gasping or choking sounds during sleep. Often you're not aware of such symptoms and must ask a family member or bed partner to report them.\n                \nLet your doctor know if anyone in your family has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or has had symptoms of the disorder.\n                \nMany people aren't aware of their symptoms and aren't diagnosed.\n                \nIf you're a parent of a child who may have sleep apnea, tell your child's doctor about your child's signs and symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check your mouth, nose, and throat for extra or large tissues. Children who have sleep apnea might have enlarged tonsils. Doctors may need only a physical exam and medical history to diagnose sleep apnea in children.\n                \nAdults who have sleep apnea may have an enlarged uvula (U-vu-luh) or soft palate. The uvula is the tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of your mouth. The soft palate is the roof of your mouth in the back of your throat.\n                \nSleep Studies\n                \nSleep studies are tests that measure how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems. These tests can help your doctor find out whether you have a sleep disorder and how severe it is. Sleep studies are the most accurate tests for diagnosing sleep apnea.\n                \nThere are different kinds of sleep studies. If your doctor thinks you have sleep apnea, he or she may recommend a polysomnogram (poly-SOM-no-gram; also called a PSG) or a home-based portable monitor.\n                \nPolysomnogram\n                \nA PSG is the most common sleep study for diagnosing sleep apnea. This study records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n                \nA PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, air movement through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you're making an effort to breathe.\n                \nPSGs often are done at sleep centers or sleep labs. The test is painless. You'll go to sleep as usual, except you'll have sensors attached to your scalp, face, chest, limbs, and a finger. The staff at the sleep center will use the sensors to check on you throughout the night.\n                \nA sleep specialist will review the results of your PSG to see whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is. He or she will use the results to plan your treatment.\n                \nYour doctor also may use a PSG to find the best setting for you on a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. CPAP is the most common treatment for sleep apnea. A CPAP machine uses mild air pressure to keep your airway open while you sleep.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have sleep apnea, he or she may schedule a split-night sleep study. During the first half of the night, your sleep will be checked without a CPAP machine. This will show whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is.\n                \nIf the PSG shows that you have sleep apnea, youll use a CPAP machine during the second half of the split-night study. The staff at the sleep center will adjust the flow of air from the CPAP machine to find the setting that works best for you.\n                \nHome-Based Portable Monitor\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a home-based sleep test with a portable monitor. The portable monitor will record some of the same information as a PSG. For example, it may record:\n                \nThe amount of oxygen in your blood\n                \nAir movement through your nose while you breathe\n                \nYour heart rate\n                \nChest movements that show whether you're making an effort to breathe\n                \nA sleep specialist may use the results from a home-based sleep test to help diagnose sleep apnea. He or she also may use the results to decide whether you need a full PSG study in a sleep center."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Sleep Apnea ?",
            "answer": "Sleep apnea is treated with lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, breathing devices, and surgery. Medicines typically aren't used to treat the condition.\n                \nThe goals of treating sleep apnea are to:\n                \nRestore regular breathing during sleep\n                \nRelieve symptoms such as loud snoring and daytime sleepiness\n                \nTreatment may improve other medical problems linked to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure. Treatment also can reduce your risk for heart disease,stroke, and diabetes.\n                \nIf you have sleep apnea, talk with your doctor or sleep specialist about the treatment options that will work best for you.\n                \nLifestyle changes and/or mouthpieces may relieve mild sleep apnea. People who have moderate or severe sleep apnea may need breathing devices or surgery.\n                \nIf you continue to have daytime sleepiness despite treatment, your doctor may ask whether you're getting enough sleep. (Adults should get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep; children and teens need more. For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency article.)\n                \nIf treatment and enough sleep don't relieve your daytime sleepiness, your doctor will consider other treatment options.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nIf you have mild sleep apnea, some changes in daily activities or habits might be all the treatment you need.\n                \nAvoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy. They make it harder for your throat to stay open while you sleep.\n                \nLose weight if you're overweight or obese. Even a little weight loss can improve your symptoms.\n                \nSleep on your side instead of your back to help keep your throat open. You can sleep with special pillows or shirts that prevent you from sleeping on your back.\n                \nKeep your nasal passages open at night with nasal sprays or allergy medicines, if needed. Talk with your doctor about whether these treatments might help you.\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking.\n                \nMouthpieces\n                \nA mouthpiece, sometimes called an oral appliance, may help some people who have mild sleep apnea. Your doctor also may recommend a mouthpiece if you snore loudly but don't have sleep apnea.\n                \nA dentist or orthodontist can make a custom-fit plastic mouthpiece for treating sleep apnea. (An orthodontist specializes in correcting teeth or jaw problems.) The mouthpiece will adjust your lower jaw and your tongue to help keep your airways open while you sleep.\n                \nIf you use a mouthpiece, tell your doctor if you have discomfort or pain while using the device. You may need periodic office visits so your doctor can adjust your mouthpiece to fit better.\n                \nBreathing Devices\n                \nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the most common treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. A CPAP machine uses a mask that fits over your mouth and nose, or just over your nose.\n                \nThe machine gently blows air into your throat. The pressure from the air helps keep your airway open while you sleep.\n                \nTreating sleep apnea may help you stop snoring. But not snoring doesn't mean that you no longer have sleep apnea or can stop using CPAP. Your sleep apnea will return if you stop using your CPAP machine or dont use it correctly.\n                \nUsually, a technician will come to your home to bring the CPAP equipment. The technician will set up the CPAP machine and adjust it based on your doctor's prescription. After the initial setup, you may need to have the CPAP adjusted from time to time for the best results.\n                \nCPAP treatment may cause side effects in some people. These side effects include a dry or stuffy nose, irritated skin on your face, dry mouth, and headaches. If your CPAP isn't adjusted properly, you may get stomach bloating and discomfort while wearing the mask.\n                \nIf you're having trouble with CPAP side effects, work with your sleep specialist, his or her nursing staff, and the CPAP technician. Together, you can take steps to reduce the side effects.\n                \nFor example, the CPAP settings or size/fit of the mask might need to be adjusted. Adding moisture to the air as it flows through the mask or using nasal spray can help relieve a dry, stuffy, or runny nose.\n                \nThere are many types of CPAP machines and masks. Tell your doctor if you're not happy with the type you're using. He or she may suggest switching to a different type that might work better for you.\n                \nPeople who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much better once they begin treatment with CPAP.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSome people who have sleep apnea might benefit from surgery. The type of surgery and how well it works depend on the cause of the sleep apnea.\n                \nSurgery is done to widen breathing passages. It usually involves shrinking, stiffening, or removing excess tissue in the mouth and throat or resetting the lower jaw.\n                \nSurgery to shrink or stiffen excess tissue is done in a doctor's office or a hospital. Shrinking tissue may involve small shots or other treatments to the tissue. You may need a series of treatments to shrink the excess tissue. To stiffen excess tissue, the doctor makes a small cut in the tissue and inserts a piece of stiff plastic.\n                \nSurgery to remove excess tissue is done in a hospital. You're given medicine to help you sleep during the surgery. After surgery, you may have throat pain that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.\n                \nSurgery to remove the tonsils, if they're blocking the airway, might be helpful for some children. Your child's doctor may suggest waiting some time to see whether these tissues shrink on their own. This is common as small children grow."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nVaricose (VAR-i-kos) veins are swollen, twisted veins that you can see just under the surface of the skin. These veins usually occur in the legs, but they also can form in other parts of the body.\n                \nVaricose veins are a common condition. They usually cause few signs and symptoms. Sometimes varicose veins cause mild to moderate pain, blood clots, skin ulcers (sores), or other problems.\n                \nOverview\n                \nVeins are blood vessels that carry blood from your body's tissues to your heart. Your heart pumps the blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then is pumped to your body through blood vessels called arteries.\n                \nFrom your arteries, the blood flows through tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where it gives up its oxygen to the body's tissues. Your blood then returns to your heart through your veins to pick up more oxygen. For more information about blood flow, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.\n                \nVeins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell, which can lead to varicose veins.\n                \nMany factors can raise your risk for varicose veins. Examples of these factors include family history, older age, gender, pregnancy, overweight or obesity, lack of movement, and leg trauma.\n                \nVaricose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures.

            "question": "What causes Varicose Veins ?",
            "answer": "Weak or damaged valves in the veins can cause varicose veins. After your arteries and capillaries deliver oxygen-rich blood to your body, your veins return the blood to your heart. The veins in your legs must work against gravity to do this.\n                \nOne-way valves inside the veins open to let blood flow through, and then they shut to keep blood from flowing backward. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell.\n                \nWeak vein walls may cause weak valves. Normally, the walls of the veins are elastic (stretchy). If these walls become weak, they lose their normal elasticity. They become like an overstretched rubber band. This makes the walls of the veins longer and wider, and it causes the flaps of the valves to separate.\n                \nWhen the valve flaps separate, blood can flow backward through the valves. The backflow of blood fills the veins and stretches the walls even more. As a result, the veins get bigger, swell, and often twist as they try to squeeze into their normal space. These are varicose veins.\n                \nNormal Vein and Varicose Vein\n                \n\n                \nFigure A shows a normal vein with a working valve and normal blood flow.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Varicose Veins ?",
            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of varicose veins include:\n                \nLarge veins that you can see just under the surface of your skin.\n                \nMild swelling of your ankles and feet.\n                \nPainful, achy, or \"heavy\" legs.\n                \nThrobbing or cramping in your legs.\n                \nItchy legs, especially on the lower leg and ankle. Sometimes this symptom is incorrectly diagnosed as dry skin.\n                \nDiscolored skin in the area around the varicose vein.\n                \nSigns of telangiectasias are clusters of red veins that you can see just under the surface of your skin. These clusters usually are found on the upper body, including the face. Signs of spider veins are red or blue veins in a web or tree branch pattern. Often, these veins appear on the legs and face.\n                \nSee your doctor if you have these signs and symptoms. They also may be signs of other, more serious conditions.\n                \nComplications of Varicose Veins\n                \nVaricose veins can lead to dermatitis (der-ma-TI-tis), an itchy rash. If you have varicose veins in your legs, dermatitis may affect your lower leg or ankle. Dermatitis can cause bleeding or skin ulcers (sores) if the skin is scratched or irritated.\n                \nVaricose veins also can lead to a condition called superficial thrombophlebitis (THROM-bo-fleh-BI-tis). Thrombophlebitis is a blood clot in a vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis means that the blood clot occurs in a vein close to the surface of the skin. This type of blood clot may cause pain and other problems in the affected area."

            "question": "How to diagnose Varicose Veins ?",
            "answer": "Doctors often diagnose varicose veins based on a physical exam alone. Sometimes tests or procedures are used to find out the extent of the problem or to rule out other conditions.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you have varicose veins, you may see a vascular medicine specialist or vascular surgeon. These doctors specialize in blood vessel conditions. You also may see a dermatologist. This type of doctor specializes in skin conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nTo check for varicose veins in your legs, your doctor will look at your legs while you're standing or sitting with your legs dangling. He or she may ask you about your signs and symptoms, including any pain you're having.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nDuplex Ultrasound\n                \nYour doctor may recommend duplex ultrasound to check blood flow in your veins and to look for blood clots. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional with Doppler ultrasound. Traditional ultrasound uses sound waves to create apicture of the structures in your body, in this case the blood vessels and anything that may be blocking the flow of blood. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the flow or movement of the blood through theveins. The two types of ultrasound together paint a picture that helps your doctor diagnose your condition.\n                \nDuring this test, a handheld device will be placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. The device sends and receives sound waves. A computer will convert the sound waves into a picture of the blood flow in your arteries and veins.\n                \nAngiogram\n                \nAlthough it is not very common, your doctor may recommend an angiogram to get a more detailed look at the blood flow through your veins.\n                \nFor this procedure, dye is injected into your veins. The dye outlines your veins on x-ray images.\n                \nAn angiogram can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or another condition."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Varicose Veins ?",
            "answer": "Varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.\n                \nIf varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. For example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins.\n                \nSome people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look.\n                \nAlthough treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. These changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. Lifestyle changes include the following:\n                \nAvoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.\n                \nDo physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.\n                \nIf you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.\n                \nAvoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.\n                \nAvoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend compression stockings. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs.\n                \nThere are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose. These offer the least amount of pressure. A second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.\n                \nPrescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. These stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nMedical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. Removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins.\n                \nYou may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. Common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain.\n                \nThe side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-GA-shun). Rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring.\n                \nSclerotherapy\n                \nSclerotherapy (SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. The chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. The irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away.\n                \nThis procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. It can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. You may need several treatments to completely close off a vein.\n                \nTreatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. Following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling.\n                \nMicrosclerotherapy\n                \nMicrosclerotherapy (MI-kro-SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins.\n                \nA small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. The chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off.\n                \nLaser Surgery\n                \nThis procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. The laser light makes the vein fade away.\n                \nLaser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. No cutting or injection of chemicals is involved.\n                \nEndovenous Ablation Therapy\n                \nEndovenous ablation (ab-LA-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein.\n                \nYour doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. He or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. A device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off.\n                \nYou'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. You usually can go home the same day as the procedure.\n                \nEndoscopic Vein Surgery\n                \nFor endoscopic (en-do-SKOP-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. He or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. A surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein.\n                \nEndoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). After the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks.\n                \nAmbulatory Phlebectomy\n                \nFor ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-BEK-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. This procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin.\n                \nYou'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. Usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done.\n                \nVein Stripping and Ligation\n                \nVein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. The procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin.\n                \nYou'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure.\n                \nVein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. The recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\n                \nAtherosclerosis\n                \n\n                \nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\n                \nIf the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface. A large blood clot can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. Over time, ruptured plaque also hardens and narrows the coronary arteries.\n                \nOverview\n                \nIf the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina or a heart attack can occur.\n                \nAngina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\n                \nA heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious health problems or death.\n                \nOver time, CHD can weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nLifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat coronary heart disease. These treatments may reduce the risk of related health problems."

            "question": "What causes Coronary Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "Research suggests that coronary heart disease (CHD) starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh levels of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh levels of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nBlood vessel inflammation\n                \nPlaque might begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.\n                \nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause angina (chest pain or discomfort).\n                \nIf the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsen angina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Coronary Heart Disease? ?",
            "answer": "In the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death for both men and women. Each year, about 370,000 Americans die from coronary heart disease.\n                \nCertain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for CHD. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop the disease.\n                \nYou can control many risk factors, which may help prevent or delay CHD.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called bad cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called good cholesterol).\n                \nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body's tissues.\n                \nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its own insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used for energy. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.\n                \nDiabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\n                \nOverweight or obesity. The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nLack of physical activity. Being physically inactive can worsen other risk factors for CHD, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can worsen other risk factors for CHD.\n                \nOlder age. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. In men, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 45. In women, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 55.\n                \nA family history of early coronary heart disease is a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease, specifically if a father or brother is diagnosed before age 55, or a mother or sister is diagnosed before age 65.\n                \nAlthough older age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn't mean that youll develop CHD if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and help prevent CHD, even in older adults.\n                \nEmerging Risk Factors\n                \nResearchers continue to study other possible risk factors for CHD.\n                \nHigh levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk of CHD and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body.\n                \nInflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls may trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.\n                \nResearch is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk of CHD and heart attack.\n                \nHigh levels of triglycerides in the blood also may raise the risk of CHD, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat.\n                \nOther Risks Related to Coronary Heart Disease\n                \nOther conditions and factors also may contribute to CHD, including:\n                \nSleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can increase your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nStress. Research shows that the most commonly reported \"trigger\" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger.\n                \nAlcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other CHD risk factors. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day.\n                \nPreeclampsia. This condition can occur during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure.\n                \nFor more detailed information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors article."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "A common symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD) is angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\n                \nAnother common symptom of CHD is shortness of breath. This symptom occurs if CHD causes heart failure. When you have heart failure, your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Fluid builds up in your lungs, making it hard to breathe.\n                \nThe severity of these symptoms varies. They may get more severe as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Heart Problems Related to Coronary Heart Disease\n                \nSome people who have CHD have no signs or symptomsa condition called silent CHD. The disease might not be diagnosed until a person has signs or symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat).\n                \nHeart Attack\n                \nA heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. This can happen if an area of plaque in a coronary artery ruptures (breaks open).\n                \nBlood cell fragments called platelets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIf the blockage isnt treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.\n                \nHeart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nThe most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back.\n                \nThe discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. The feeling can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn.\n                \nThe symptoms of angina can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest.\n                \nChest pain or discomfort that doesnt go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while youre resting) might be a sign of a heart attack. If you dont know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911.\n                \nAll chest pain should be checked by a doctor.\n                \nOther common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:\n                \nUpper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach\n                \nShortness of breath, which may occur with or before chest discomfort\n                \nNausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, light-headedness or fainting, or breaking out in a cold sweat\n                \nSleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), or lack of energy\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Heart Attack article.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working.\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing; fatigue; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, stomach, and veins in the neck.\n                \nAll of these symptoms are the result of fluid buildup in your body. When symptoms start, you may feel tired and short of breath after routine physical effort, like climbing stairs.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Heart Failure article.\n                \nArrhythmia\n                \nAn arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. When you have an arrhythmia, you may notice that your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast.\n                \nSome people describe arrhythmias as a fluttering feeling in the chest. These feelings are called palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns).\n                \nSome arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. This condition is called sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Arrhythmia article."

            "question": "How to diagnose Coronary Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose coronary heart disease (CHD) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors for CHD, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nNo single test can diagnose CHD. If your doctor thinks you have CHD, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nStress Testing\n                \nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nWhen your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\n                \nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\n                \nShortness of breath or chest pain\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\n                \nIf you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. However, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases, anemia, or poor general fitness).\n                \nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography(echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels might be a sign that you're at risk for CHD.\n                \nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\n                \nYour doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors show that you're likely to have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nCardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Coronary Heart Disease ?",
            "answer": "Treatments for coronary heart disease include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures and surgery, and cardiac rehabilitation. Treatment goals may include:\n                \nLowering the risk of blood clots forming (blood clots can cause a heart attack)\n                \nPreventing complications of coronary heart disease\n                \nReducing risk factors in an effort to slow, stop, or reverse the buildup of plaque\n                \nRelieving symptoms\n                \nWidening or bypassing clogged arteries\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have coronary heart disease. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nCoronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a stroke\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\n                \nLower your blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\n                \nPrevent or delay the need for a stent or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n                \nReduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.\n                \n\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nYou may need a procedure or surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Both PCIand CABG are used to treat blocked coronary arteries. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you.\n                \nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after angioplasty. Read more about this procedure at PCI.\n                \nCoronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n                \nCABG is a type of surgery in which arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nRead more about this surgery at CABG.\n                \nCardiac Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) for angina or after CABG, angioplasty, or a heart attack. Nearly everyone who has coronary heart disease can benefit from cardiac rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.\n                \nThe cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.\n                \nRehab has two parts:\n                \nEducation, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future.\n                \nExercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.\n                \nRead more about this therapy at Cardiac Rehabilitation."

            "question": "What is (are) Coronary Microvascular Disease ?",
            "answer": "Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) is heart disease that affects the tiny coronary (heart) arteries. In coronary MVD, the walls of the heart's tiny arteries are damaged or diseased.\n                \nCoronary MVD is different from traditional coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. In CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up in the large coronary arteries.\n                \nPlaque narrows the heart's large arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIn coronary MVD, however, the heart's tiny arteries are affected. Plaque doesn't create blockages in these vessels as it does in the heart's large arteries.\n                \nCoronary Microvascular Disease\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nBoth men and women who have coronary microvascular disease often have diabetes or high blood pressure. Some people who have coronary microvascular disease may have inherited heart muscle diseases.\n                \nDiagnosing coronary microvascular disease has been a challenge for doctors. Standard tests used to diagnose coronary heart disease arent designed to detect coronary microvascular disease. More research is needed to find the best diagnostic tests and treatments for thedisease.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMost of what is known about coronary MVD comes from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Wise study (Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation).\n                \nThe WISE study started in 1996. The goal of the study was to learn more about how heart disease develops in women.\n                \nCurrently, research is ongoing to learn more about the role of hormones in heart disease and to find better ways to diagnose coronary MVD.\n                \nStudies also are under way to learn more about the causes of coronary MVD, how to treat the disease, and the expected health outcomes for people with coronary MVD."

            "question": "What causes Coronary Microvascular Disease ?",
            "answer": "The same risk factors that cause atherosclerosis may cause coronary microvascular disease. Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries.\n                \nRisk factors for atherosclerosis include:\n                \nDiabetes. It is a disease in which the bodys blood sugar level is too high because the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly.\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk of atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before age 55, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before age 65.\n                \nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body cant use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy. Overtime, insulin resistance can lead to diabetes.\n                \nLack of physical activity. Physical inactivity can worsen some other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\n                \nOlder age. As you age, your risk for atherosclerosis increases. The process of atherosclerosis begins in youth and typically progresses over many decades before disease develops.\n                \nOverweight and obesity. The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesnt allow enough oxygen to reach the bodys tissues.\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL (bad) cholesterol and low HDL (good) cholesterol.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis.\n                \nIn women, coronary microvascular disease also may be linked to low estrogen levels occurring before or after menopause. Also, the disease may be linked to anemia or conditions that affect blood clotting. Anemia is thought to slow the growth of cells needed to repair damaged blood vessels.\n                \nResearchers continue to explore other possible causes of coronary microvascular disease."

However, women may be at risk for coronary microvascular disease if they have lower than normal levels of estrogen at any point in their adult lives. (This refers to the estrogen that the ovaries produce, not the estrogen used in hormone therapy.) Low estrogen levels before menopause can raise younger womens risk for the disease. Causes of low estrogen levels in younger women can be mental stress or a problem with the function of theovaries.\n                \nThe causes of coronary microvascular disease and atherosclerosis are also considered risk factors for the disease."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Coronary Microvascular Disease ?",
            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of coronary microvascular disease (MVD) often differ from the signs and symptoms of traditional coronary heart disease (CHD).\n                \nMany women with coronary MVD have angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh). Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\n                \nAngina also is a common symptom of CHD. However, the angina that occurs in coronary MVD may differ from the typical angina that occurs in CHD. In coronary MVD, the chest pain usually lasts longer than 10 minutes, and it can last longer than 30 minutes. Typical angina is more common in women older than 65.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of coronary MVD are shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.\n                \nCoronary MVD symptoms often are first noticed during routine daily activities (such as shopping, cooking, cleaning, and going to work) and times of mental stress. It's less likely that women will notice these symptoms during physical activity (such as jogging or walking fast).\n                \nThis differs from CHD, in which symptoms often first appear while a person is being physically activesuch as while jogging, walking on a treadmill, or going up stairs."

            "question": "How to diagnose Coronary Microvascular Disease ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose coronary microvascular disease (MVD) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will check to see whether you have any risk factors for heart disease.\n                \nFor example, your doctor may measure your weight and height to check for overweight or obesity. He or she also may recommend tests for high blood cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.\n                \nYour doctor may ask you to describe any chest pain, including when it started and how it changed during physical activity or periods of stress. He or she also may ask about other symptoms, such as fatigue (tiredness), lack of energy, and shortness of breath. Women may be asked about their menopausal status.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nCardiologists and doctors who specialize in family and internal medicine might help diagnose and treat coronary MVD. Cardiologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nThe risk factors for coronary MVD and traditional coronary heart disease (CHD) often are the same. Thus, your doctor may recommend tests for CHD, such as:\n                \nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee). This test uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. Coronary angiography can show plaque buildup in the large coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries.\n                \nStress testing. This test shows how blood flows through your heart during physical stress, such as exercise. Even if coronary angiography doesn't show plaque buildup in the large coronary arteries, a stress test may still show abnormal blood flow. This may be a sign of coronary MVD.\n                \nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) stress test. Doctors may use this test to evaluate people who have chest pain.\n                \nUnfortunately, standard tests for CHD aren't designed to detect coronary MVD. These tests look for blockages in the large coronary arteries. Coronary MVD affects the tiny coronary arteries.\n                \nIf test results show that you don't have CHD, your doctor might still diagnose you with coronary MVD. This could happen if signs are present that not enough oxygen is reaching your heart's tiny arteries.\n                \nCoronary MVD symptoms often first occur during routine daily tasks. Thus, your doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire called the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). The questionnaire will ask you how well you're able to do daily activities, such as shopping, cooking, and going to work.\n                \nThe DASI results will help your doctor decide which kind of stress test you should have. The results also give your doctor information about how well blood is flowing through your coronary arteries.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests, including a test for anemia. Anemia is thought to slow the growth of cells needed to repair damaged blood vessels.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for better ways to detect and diagnose coronary MVD. Currently, researchers have not agreed on the best way to diagnose the disease."

            "answer": "Relieving pain is one of the main goals of treating coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Treatments also are used to control risk factors and other symptoms. Treatments may include medicines, such as:\n                \nACE inhibitors and beta blockers to lower blood pressure and decrease the hearts workload\n                \nAspirin to help prevent blood clots or control inflammation\n                \nNitroglycerin to relax blood vessels, improve blood flow to the heart muscle, and treat chest pain\n                \nStatin medicines to control or lower your blood cholesterol.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\n                \nIf youre diagnosed with coronary MVD and also haveanemia, you may benefit from treatment for that condition. Anemia is thought to slow the growth of cells needed to repair damaged blood vessels.\n                \nIf youre diagnosed with and treated for coronary MVD, you should get ongoing care from your doctor.

Coronary microvascular disease affects the tiny coronary arteries; coronary heart disease affects the large coronary arteries.\n                \nTaking action to control risk factors for heart disease can help prevent or delay coronary heart disease. You cant control some risk factors, such as older age and family history of heart disease. However, you can take steps to prevent or control other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, overweight and obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking.\n                \nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes and ongoing medical care can help you lower your risk for heartdisease.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have coronary microvascular disease. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas.\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nOngoing Medical Care\n                \nLearn more about heart disease and the traits, conditions, and habits that can raise your risk for developing it. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for heart disease and how to controlthem.\n                \nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. Visit your doctor regularly and have recommended testing.\n                \nKnow your numbers. Ask your doctor for these three tests and have the results explained toyou:\n                \nBlood pressure measurement.\n                \nFasting blood glucose. This test is for diabetes.\n                \nLipoprotein panel. This test measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).\n                \nFinally, know your family history of heart disease. If you or someone in your family has heart disease, tell your doctor."

            "question": "What is (are) Atrial Fibrillation ?",
            "answer": "Atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), or AF, is the most common type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\n                \nAF occurs if rapid, disorganized electrical signals cause the heart's two upper chamberscalled the atria (AY-tree-uh)to fibrillate. The term \"fibrillate\" means to contract very fast and irregularly.\n                \nIn AF, blood pools in the atria. It isn't pumped completely into the heart's two lower chambers, called the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls). As a result, the heart's upper and lower chambers don't work together as they should.\n                \nPeople who have AF may not feel symptoms. However, even when AF isn't noticed, it can increase the risk of stroke. In some people, AF can cause chest pain or heart failure, especially if the heart rhythm is very rapid.\n                \nAF may happen rarely or every now and then, or it may become an ongoing or long-term heart problem that lasts for years.\n                \nUnderstanding the Heart's Electrical System\n                \nTo understand AF, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\n                \nEach electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the right atrium. In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node sends an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute. (This rate may be slower in very fit athletes.)\n                \nFrom the SA node, the electrical signal travels through the right and left atria. It causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles.\n                \nThe electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down slightly, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.\n                \nThe electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels to the ventricles. It causes the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. The ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node.\n                \nFor more information about the heart's electrical system and detailed animations, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works article.\n                \nUnderstanding the Electrical Problem in Atrial Fibrillation\n                \nIn AF, the heart's electrical signals don't begin in the SA node. Instead, they begin in another part of the atria or in the nearby pulmonary veins. The signals don't travel normally. They may spread throughout the atria in a rapid, disorganized way. This can cause the atria to fibrillate.\n                \nThe faulty signals flood the AV node with electrical impulses. As a result, the ventricles also begin to beat very fast. However, the AV node can't send the signals to the ventricles as fast as they arrive. So, even though the ventricles are beating faster than normal, they aren't beating as fast as the atria.\n                \nThus, the atria and ventricles no longer beat in a coordinated way. This creates a fast and irregular heart rhythm. In AF, the ventricles may beat 100 to 175 times a minute, in contrast to the normal rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\n                \nIf this happens, blood isn't pumped into the ventricles as well as it should be. Also, the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles to the body is based on the random atrial beats.\n                \nThe body may get rapid, small amounts of blood and occasional larger amounts of blood. The amount will depend on how much blood has flowed from the atria to the ventricles with each beat.\n                \nMost of the symptoms of AF are related to how fast the heart is beating. If medicines or age slow the heart rate, the symptoms are minimized.\n                \nAF may be brief, with symptoms that come and go and end on their own. Or, the condition may be ongoing and require treatment. Sometimes AF is permanent, and medicines or other treatments can't restore a normal heart rhythm.\n                \nThe animation below shows atrial fibrillation.

Use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nThe animation shows how the heart's electrical signal can begin somewhere other than the sinoatrial node. This causes the atria to beat very fast and irregularly.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPeople who have AF can live normal, active lives. For some people, treatment can restore normal heart rhythms.\n                \nFor people who have permanent AF, treatment can help control symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes."

Instead, they become very rapid and disorganized.\n                \nDamage to the heart's electrical system causes AF. The damage most often is the result of other conditions that affect the health of the heart, such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease.\n                \nThe risk of AF increases as you age.

In the United States, AF is more common among Whites than African Americans or Hispanic Americans.\n                \nThe risk of AF increases as you age.

However, about half of the people who have AF are younger than 75.\n                \nAF is uncommon in children.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nAF is more common in people who have:\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nCoronary heart disease (CHD)\n                \nHeart failure\n                \nRheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) heart disease\n                \nStructural heart defects, such as mitral valve prolapse\n                \nPericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis; a condition in which the membrane, or sac, around your heart is inflamed)\n                \nCongenital heart defects\n                \nSick sinus syndrome (a condition in which the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly and the heart rate slows down; sometimes the heart will switch back and forth between a slow rate and a fast rate)\n                \nAF also is more common in people who are having heart attacks or who have just had surgery.\n                \nOther Risk Factors\n                \nOther conditions that raise your risk for AF include hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), obesity, diabetes, and lung disease.\n                \nCertain factors also can raise your risk for AF. For example, drinking large amounts of alcohol, especially binge drinking, raises your risk. Even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger AF in some people. Caffeine or psychological stress also may trigger AF in some people.\n                \nSome data suggest that people who have sleep apnea are at greater risk for AF. Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome also raises your risk for AF. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nResearch suggests that people who receive high-dose steroid therapy are at increased risk for AF. This therapy is used for asthma and some inflammatory conditions. It may act as a trigger in people who have other AF risk factors.\n                \nGenetic factors also may play a role in causing AF. However, their role isn't fully known."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation ?",
            "answer": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) usually causes the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, to contract faster than normal.\n                \nWhen this happens, the ventricles can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body. This can lead to signs and symptoms, such as:\n                \nPalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast)\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nWeakness or problems exercising\n                \nChest pain\n                \nDizziness or fainting\n                \nFatigue (tiredness)\n                \nConfusion\n                \nAtrial Fibrillation Complications\n                \nAF has two major complicationsstroke and heart failure.\n                \nStroke\n                \nDuring AF, the heart's upper chambers, the atria, don't pump all of their blood to the ventricles. Some blood pools in the atria. When this happens, a blood clot (also called a thrombus) can form.\n                \nIf the clot breaks off and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke. (A clot that forms in one part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to another part of the body is called an embolus.)\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines that reduce the risk of stroke are an important part of treatment for people who have AF.\n                \nAtrial Fibrillation and Stroke\n                \n\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. AF can lead to heart failure because the ventricles are beating very fast and can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body.\n                \nFatigue and shortness of breath are common symptoms of heart failure. A buildup of fluid in the lungs causes these symptoms. Fluid also can build up in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing weight gain.\n                \nLifestyle changes, medicines, and procedures or surgery (rarely, a mechanical heart pump or heart transplant) are the main treatments for heart failure."

            "question": "How to diagnose Atrial Fibrillation ?",
            "answer": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSometimes AF doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Thus, it may be found during a physical exam or EKG (electrocardiogram) test done for another purpose.\n                \nIf you have AF, your doctor will want to find out what is causing it. This will help him or her plan the best way to treat the condition.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctors often are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of AF. These doctors include family practitioners and internists.\n                \nDoctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease also may be involved, such as:\n                \nCardiologists. These are doctors who diagnose and treat heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nElectrophysiologists. These are cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will likely ask questions about your:\n                \nSigns and symptoms. What symptoms are you having? Have you had palpitations? Are you dizzy or short of breath? Are your feet or ankles swollen (a possible sign of heart failure)? Do you have any chest pain?\n                \nMedical history. Do you have other health problems, such as a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, lung disease, diabetes, or thyroid problems?\n                \nFamily's medical history. Does anyone in your family have a history of AF? Has anyone in your family ever had heart disease or high blood pressure? Has anyone had thyroid problems? Does your family have a history of other illnesses or health problems?\n                \nHealth habits. Do you smoke or use alcohol or caffeine?\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a complete cardiac exam. He or she will listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat and take your pulse and blood pressure reading. Your doctor will likely check for any signs of heart muscle or heart valve problems. He or she will listen to your lungs to check for signs of heart failure.\n                \nYour doctor also will check for swelling in your legs or feet and look for an enlarged thyroid gland or other signs of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone).\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nEKG\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. It's the most useful test for diagnosing AF.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect AF that doesn't happen during the test. To diagnose paroxysmal AF, your doctor may ask you to wear a portable EKG monitor that can record your heartbeat for longer periods.\n                \nThe two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nA Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear small patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect these patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.\n                \nYou wear the Holter monitor while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nFor many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nYou can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nThis test sometimes is called transthoracic (trans-thor-AS-ik) echocardiography. It's painless and noninvasive (no instruments are inserted into the body). For the test, a device called a transducer is moved back and forth over your chest. The device sends special sound waves through your chest wall to your heart.\n                \nThe sound waves bounce off the structures of your heart, and a computer converts them into pictures on a screen.\n                \nTransesophageal Echocardiography\n                \nTransesophageal (trans-e-SOF-ah-ge-al) echo, or TEE, uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach.\n                \nYour heart's upper chambers, the atria, are deep in your chest. They often can't be seen very well using transthoracic echo. Your doctor can see the atria much better using TEE.\n                \nDuring this test, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus. You'll likely be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure.\n                \nTEE is used to detect blood clots that may be forming in the atria because of AF.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show fluid buildup in the lungs and signs of other AF complications.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the level of thyroid hormone in your body and the balance of your body's electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They're essential for normal health and functioning of your body's cells and organs."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Atrial Fibrillation ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) depends on how often you have symptoms, how severe they are, and whether you already have heart disease. General treatment options include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nThe goals of treating AF include:\n                \nPreventing blood clots from forming, thus lowering the risk of stroke.\n                \nControlling how many times a minute the ventricles contract. This is called rate control. Rate control is important because it allows the ventricles enough time to completely fill with blood. With this approach, the abnormal heart rhythm continues, but you feel better and have fewer symptoms.\n                \nRestoring a normal heart rhythm. This is called rhythm control. Rhythm control allows the atria and ventricles to work together to efficiently pump blood to the body.\n                \nTreating any underlying disorder that's causing or raising the risk of AFfor example, hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone).\n                \nWho Needs Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation?\n                \nPeople who have AF but don't have symptoms or related heart problems may not need treatment. AF may even go back to a normal heart rhythm on its own. (This also can occur in people who have AF with symptoms.)\n                \nIn some people who have AF for the first time, doctors may choose to use an electrical procedure or medicine to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n                \nRepeat episodes of AF tend to cause changes to the heart's electrical system, leading to persistent or permanent AF. Most people who have persistent or permanent AF need treatment to control their heart rate and prevent complications.\n                \nSpecific Types of Treatment\n                \nBlood Clot Prevention\n                \nPeople who have AF are at increased risk for stroke. This is because blood can pool in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), causing a blood clot to form. If the clot breaks off and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke.\n                \nPreventing blood clots from forming is probably the most important part of treating AF. The benefits of this type of treatment have been proven in multiple studies.\n                \nDoctors prescribe blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots. These medicines include warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin.\n                \nPeople taking blood-thinning medicines need regular blood tests to check how well the medicines are working.\n                \nRate Control\n                \nDoctors can prescribe medicines to slow down the rate at which the ventricles are beating. These medicines help bring the heart rate to a normal level.\n                \nRate control is the recommended treatment for most patients who have AF, even though an abnormal heart rhythm continues and the heart doesn't work as well as it should. Most people feel better and can function well if their heart rates are well-controlled.\n                \nMedicines used to control the heart rate include beta blockers (for example, metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), and digitalis (digoxin). Several other medicines also are available.\n                \nRhythm Control\n                \nRestoring and maintaining a normal heart rhythm is a treatment approach recommended for people who aren't doing well with rate control treatment. This treatment also may be used for people who have only recently started having AF. The long-term benefits of rhythm control have not been proven conclusively yet.\n                \nDoctors use medicines or procedures to control the heart's rhythm. Patients often begin rhythm control treatment in a hospital so that their hearts can be closely watched.\n                \nThe longer you have AF, the less likely it is that doctors can restore a normal heart rhythm. This is especially true for people who have had AF for 6 months or more.\n                \nRestoring a normal rhythm also becomes less likely if the atria are enlarged or if any underlying heart disease worsens. In these cases, the chance that AF will recur is high, even if you're taking medicine to help convert AF to a normal rhythm.\n                \nMedicines. Medicines used to control the heart rhythm include amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, and ibutilide. Sometimes older medicinessuch as quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramideare used.\n                \nYour doctor will carefully tailor the dose and type of medicines he or she prescribes to treat your AF. This is because medicines used to treat AF can cause a different kind of arrhythmia.\n                \nThese medicines also can harm people who have underlying diseases of the heart or other organs. This is especially true for patients who have an unusual heart rhythm problem called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\n                \nYour doctor may start you on a small dose of medicine and then gradually increase the dose until your symptoms are controlled. Medicines used for rhythm control can be given regularly by injection at a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. Or, you may routinely take pills to try to control AF or prevent repeat episodes.\n                \nIf your doctor knows how you'll react to a medicine, a specific dose may be prescribed for you to take on an as-needed basis if you have an episode of AF.\n                \nProcedures. Doctors use several procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm. For example, they may use electrical cardioversion to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat. For this procedure, low-energy shocks are given to your heart to trigger a normal rhythm. You're temporarily put to sleep before you receive the shocks.\n                \nElectrical cardioversion isn't the same as the emergency heart shocking procedure often seen on TV programs. It's planned in advance and done under carefully controlled conditions.\n                \nBefore doing electrical cardioversion, your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This test can rule out the presence of blood clots in the atria. If clots are present, you may need to take blood-thinning medicines before the procedure. These medicines can help get rid of the clots.\n                \nCatheter ablation (ab-LA-shun) may be used to restore a normal heart rhythm if medicines or electrical cardioversion don't work. For this procedure, a wire is inserted through a vein in the leg or arm and threaded to the heart.\n                \nRadio wave energy is sent through the wire to destroy abnormal tissue that may be disrupting the normal flow of electrical signals. An electrophysiologist usually does this procedure in a hospital. Your doctor may recommend a TEE before catheter ablation to check for blood clots in the atria.\n                \nSometimes doctors use catheter ablation to destroy the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node is where the heart's electrical signals pass from the atria to the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers). This procedure requires your doctor to surgically implant a device called a pacemaker, which helps maintain a normal heart rhythm.\n                \nResearch on the benefits of catheter ablation as a treatment for AF is still ongoing. (For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article.)\n                \nAnother procedure to restore a normal heart rhythm is called maze surgery. For this procedure, the surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals.\n                \nThis procedure requires open-heart surgery, so it's usually done when a person requires heart surgery for other reasons, such as for heart valve disease (which can increase the risk of AF).\n                \nApproaches To Treating Underlying Causes and Reducing Risk Factors\n                \nYour doctor may recommend treatments for an underlying cause of AF or to reduce AF risk factors. For example, he or she may prescribe medicines to treat an overactive thyroid, lower high blood pressure, or manage high blood cholesterol.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, cutting back on salt intake (to help lower blood pressure), quitting smoking, and reducing stress.\n                \nLimiting or avoiding alcohol, caffeine, or other stimulants that may increase your heart rate also can help reduce your risk for AF."

            "question": "What is (are) ARDS ?",
            "answer": "ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. They might already be in the hospital when they develop ARDS.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand ARDS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nSmall blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. Oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. Blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.\n                \nIn ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause fluid to build up in the air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.\n                \nAs a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. Without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.\n                \nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMore people are surviving ARDS now than in the past. One likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. Survival rates for ARDS vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ARDS, associated illnesses, and other factors.\n                \nSome people who survive recover completely. Others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.\n                \nResearchers continue to look for new and better ways to treat ARDS."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of ARDS ?",
            "answer": "The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms depend on the cause of ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if pneumonia is causing ARDS, you may have a cough and fever before you feel short of breath.\n                \nSometimes people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as low blood pressure, confusion, and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and heart, aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.\n                \nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.\n                \nComplications From ARDS\n                \nIf you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are: \n                \nInfections. Being in the hospital and lying down for a long time can put you at risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also puts you at higher risk for infections.\n                \nA pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This is a condition in which air or gas collects in the space around the lungs. This can cause one or both lungs to collapse. The air pressure from a ventilator can cause this condition.\n                \nLung scarring. ARDS causes the lungs to become stiff (scarred). It also makes it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air. Being on a ventilator also can cause lung scarring.\n                \nBlood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in your body. A blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body is called a deep vein thrombosis. This type of blood clot can break off, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism."

            "question": "How to diagnose ARDS ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS. For a list of these conditions, go to \"Who Is at Risk for ARDS?\"\n                \nYour doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as heart failure. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.\n                \nHe or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.\n                \nYour doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nInitial Tests\n                \nThe first tests done are:\n                \nAn arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. A low blood oxygen level might be a sign of ARDS.\n                \nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether you have extra fluid in your lungs.\n                \nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count, blood chemistries, and blood cultures. These tests help find the cause of ARDS, such as an infection.\n                \nA sputum culture. This test is used to study the spit you've coughed up from your lungs. A sputum culture can help find the cause of an infection.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests used to diagnose ARDS include:\n                \nChest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or chest CT scan. This test uses a computer to create detailed pictures of your lungs. A chest CT scan may show lung problems, such as fluid in the lungs, signs of pneumonia, or a tumor.\n                \nHeart tests that look for signs of heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This condition can cause fluid to build up in your lungs."

            "question": "What are the treatments for ARDS ?",
            "answer": "ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nOne of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.\n                \nOxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a breathing tube. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.\n                \nBefore inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.\n                \nThe breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.\n                \nYour doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.\n                \nYou'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).\n                \nThis procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\n                \nSupportive Care\n                \nSupportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:\n                \nMedicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain.\n                \nOngoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange).\n                \nNutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube.\n                \nTreatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections.\n                \nPrevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots.\n                \nPrevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk.\n                \nFluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels."

            "question": "What is (are) Asbestos-Related Lung Diseases ?",
            "answer": "Asbestos-related lung diseases are diseases caused by exposure to asbestos (as-BES-tos) fibers. Asbestos is a mineral that, in the past, was widely used in many industries.\n                \nAsbestos is made up of tiny fibers that can escape into the air. When breathed in, these fibers can stay in your lungs for a long time. If the fibers build up in your lungs, they can lead to:\n                \nPleural plaque. In this condition, the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs) thickens and hardens. This tissue is called the pleura. Pleural plaque usually causes no symptoms. Rarely, as the pleura thickens, it can trap and compress part of the lung. This may show up as a mass on an x-ray image.\n                \nPleural effusion. In this condition, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the lungs and the chest wall.\n                \nAsbestosis (as-bes-TOE-sis). In this condition, the lung tissue becomes scarred. People who have asbestosis are at greater risk for lung cancer, especially if they smoke.\n                \nLung cancer. This type of cancer forms in the lung tissue, usually in the cells lining the air passages.\n                \nMesothelioma (MEZ-o-thee-lee-O-ma). This disease is cancer of the pleura.\n                \nAsbestos also can cause cancer in the lining of the abdominal cavity. This lining is known as the peritoneum (PER-ih-to-NE-um).\n                \nAsbestos-Related Lung Diseases\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nUntil the 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the United States. For example, it was used to insulate pipes, boilers, and ships; make brakes; strengthen cement; and fireproof many items, such as drywall.\n                \nPeople who worked around asbestos during that time are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. People at highest risk include:\n                \nUnprotected workers who made, installed, or removed products containing asbestos. People who worked near others who did these jobs also are at risk.\n                \nFamily members of workers who were exposed to asbestos. Family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that workers brought home on their clothes, shoes, or bodies.\n                \nPeople who live in areas with large deposits of asbestos in the soil. This risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air.\n                \nAsbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestos-made products are destroyed. Removing these products during building renovations also can release asbestos fibers into the air.\n                \nGenerally, being around asbestos-made products isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.\n                \nPeople in the United States are less likely to have asbestos-related lung diseases now because the mineral is no longer widely used.\n                \nThe use of asbestos is heavily restricted, and rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure. Asbestos is found in only a few new products, such as gaskets used in brakes.\n                \nHowever, many countries do not yet restrict asbestos use. People in those countries are still exposed to the mineral.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe outlook for people who have asbestos-related lung diseases can vary. It will depend on which disease a person has and how much it has damaged the lungs.\n                \nNo treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs. However, treatments may help relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and prevent complications.\n                \nIf you've been exposed to asbestos, let your doctor know. He or she can watch you for signs of asbestos-related problems and start treatment early, if needed. Early treatment may help prevent or delay complications.\n                \nQuitting smoking and making other lifestyle changes may help people who are at high risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. These lifestyle changes may prevent more serious diseases, such as cancer."

            "answer": "Significant exposure to asbestos fibers causes asbestos-related lung diseases. \"Significant\" usually means you were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from the fibers.\n                \nAsbestos fibers are very small. When you breathe in, they can get stuck deep in your lungs. The fibers remain in your lung tissue for a long time and may cause scarring and inflammation. This can lead to pleural plaque and widespread pleural thickening, pleural effusion, asbestosis, lung cancer, or mesothelioma.\n                \nGenerally, asbestos-related lung diseases develop 10 to 40 or more years after a person has been exposed to asbestos.\n                \nBeing around products that contain asbestos isn't a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed.

During that time, workplace rules to ensure workers' safety around asbestos weren't required by law.\n                \nAsbestos was used in or with many products. Examples include steam pipes, boilers, furnaces, and furnace ducts; wallboard; floor and ceiling tiles; wood-burning stoves and gas fireplaces; car brakes, clutches, and gaskets; railroad engines; roofing and shingles; and wall-patching materials and paints.\n                \nAsbestos also was used in many other products, such as fireproof gloves, ironing board covers, cooking pot handles, and hairdryers.\n                \nAnyone employed for a prolonged period in mining, milling, making, or installing asbestos products before the late 1970s is at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. Some examples of these workers include:\n                \nMiners\n                \nAircraft and auto mechanics\n                \nBuilding construction workers\n                \nElectricians\n                \nShipyard workers\n                \nBoiler operators\n                \nBuilding engineers\n                \nRailroad workers\n                \nIn general, the risk is greatest for people who worked with asbestos and were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from asbestos fibers.

Other specialists also may be involved in your care, including a:\n                \nPulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases.\n                \nRadiologist. This is a doctor who is specially trained to supervise x-ray tests and look at x-ray pictures.\n                \nSurgeon or oncologist. An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating cancer. The surgeon or oncologist may take a tissue sample from your lungs to study under a microscope.\n                \nPathologist. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. A pathologist may study your tissue sample.\n                \nExposure to Asbestos\n                \nYour doctor will want to know about your history of asbestos exposure. He or she may ask about your work history and your spouse's or other family members work histories.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask about your location and surroundings. For example, he or she may ask about areas of the country where you've lived.\n                \nIf you know you were exposed to asbestos, your doctor may ask questions to find out:\n                \nHow much asbestos you were exposed to. For example, were you surrounded by visible asbestos dust?\n                \nHow long you were exposed to asbestos and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it.\n                \nSymptoms\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether you have any symptoms, such as shortness of breath or coughing. The symptoms of asbestos-related lung diseases vary. They depend on which disease you have and how much it has damaged your lungs.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you smoke. Smoking, along with asbestos exposure, raises your risk for lung cancer.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any strange sounds.\n                \nIf you have a pleural effusion with a lot of fluid buildup, your doctor might hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. Or, he or she might have trouble hearing any breathing sounds. If you have asbestosis, your doctor may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in.\n                \nYour doctor will check your legs for swelling, which may be a sign of lung-related problems. He or she also will check your fingers and toes for clubbing.\n                \nClubbing is the widening and rounding of the fingertips and toes. Clubbing most often is linked to heart and lung diseases that cause lower-than-normal blood oxygen levels.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is the most common test for detecting asbestos-related lung diseases. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as the lungs.\n                \nA chest x ray cant detect asbestos fibers in the lungs. However, it can show asbestos-related diseases, such as pleural plaque and pleural effusion. Pleural effusion also can be a sign of a more severe disease, such as mesothelioma.\n                \nA chest x ray also can show asbestosis. Often the lung tissue will appear very white on the x-ray pictures. The size, shape, location, and degree of whiteness can help your doctor figure out how much lung damage you have. Severe asbestosis may affect the whole lung and have a honeycomb look on the x-ray pictures.\n                \nIf you have lung cancer, a chest x ray may show masses or abnormal fluid.\n                \nIf you have mesothelioma, a chest x ray will show thickening of the pleura. The pleura is the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). The chest xray also will usually show signs of pleural effusion in people who have mesothelioma.\n                \nOther Diagnostic Tests\n                \nTo help confirm a chest x-ray finding, or to find out how much lung damage you have, you may have more tests.\n                \nChest Computed Tomography Scan\n                \nA chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your lungs. A CT scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than standard chest x-ray pictures.\n                \nA chest CT scan may be very helpful for finding asbestosis in its earliest stages, before a standard chest x ray can detect it.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\n                \nThese tests can show whether your lung function is impaired. They also can help your doctor track your disease over time.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of lung cancer or mesothelioma is for a pathologist to check samples of your lung cells or tissues. A pathologist is a doctor who identifies diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.\n                \nDoctors have many ways to collect tissue samples. One way is through bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, your doctor will pass a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. He or she will then take a sample of tissue from your lungs.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have mesothelioma, you may have a thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, you'll be given medicine so you don't feel any pain.\n                \nYour doctor will make a small cut through your chest wall. He or she will put a thin tube with a light on it into your chest between two ribs. This allows your doctor to see inside your chest and get tissue samples."

If you have lung cancer, treatments may help slow the progress of the disease.\n                \nTreatments for Pleural Plaque, Pleural Effusion, and Asbestosis\n                \nIf you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis and you smoke, your doctor will advise you to quit smoking. People who have these conditions can lower their risk for lung cancer if they quit smoking.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking.\n                \nIf you have trouble breathing or shortness of breath and a very low blood oxygen level, your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy. For this treatment, you're given oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy may be done at home or in a hospital or other health facility.\n                \nIf excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) is making it hard for you to breathe, thoracentesis (THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis) may help. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the space between your lungs and chest wall. He or she will then draw out the excess fluid.\n                \nTreatments for Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma\n                \nIf you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, your treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or targeted therapy. (Targeted therapy uses medicines or other substances to find and attack specific lung cancer cells without harming normal cells.)\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent fluid buildup, ease pain, or relieve other complications of your disease.\n                \nIf you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, talk with your doctor about whether you should get flu and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can help lower your risk for lung infections."

            "question": "How to prevent Asbestos-Related Lung Diseases ?",
            "answer": "You can prevent asbestos-related lung diseases by limiting your exposure to asbestos fibers. If your job requires you to work around asbestos, make sure to follow workplace rules for handling it. For example, make sure that air levels are measured, and wear a proper respirator to avoid breathing in asbestos fibers.\n                \nIf you live in a house or work in a building that has pipes or other products containing asbestos, you generally dont need to take special precautions. Being around products that contain asbestos isnt a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking greatly increases your risk of lung cancer if you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group.

            "question": "Who is at risk for Smoking and Your Heart? ?",
            "answer": "The chemicals in tobacco smoke harm your heart and blood vessels in many ways. For example, they:\n                \nContribute to inflammation, which may trigger plaque buildup in your arteries.\n                \nDamage blood vessel walls, making them stiff and less elastic (stretchy). This damage narrows the blood vessels and contributes to the damage caused by unhealthy cholesterol levels.\n                \nDisturb normal heart rhythms.\n                \nIncrease your blood pressure and heart rate, making your heart work harder thannormal.\n                \nLower your HDL (good) cholesterol and raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Smoking also increases your triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in theblood.\n                \nThicken your blood and make it harder for your blood to carry oxygen.\n                \nSmoking and Heart Disease Risk\n                \nSmoking is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, a condition in which plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nOver time, smoking contributes to atherosclerosis and increases your risk of having and dying from heart disease, heart failure, or a heartattack.\n                \nCompared with nonsmokers, people who smoke are more likely to have heart disease and suffer from a heart attack. The risk of having or dying from a heart attack is even higher among people who smoke and already have heart disease.\n                \nFor some people, such as women who use birth control pills and people who have diabetes, smoking poses an even greater risk to the heart and blood vessels.\n                \nSmoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. When combined with other risk factorssuch as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and overweight or obesitysmoking further raises the risk of heart disease.\n                \nSmoking and the Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease\n                \nPeripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Smoking is a major risk factor for P.A.D.\n                \nP.A.D. usually affects the arteries that carry blood to your legs. Blocked blood flow in the leg arteries can cause cramping, pain, weakness, and numbness in your hips, thighs, and calf muscles.\n                \nBlocked blood flow also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limb. Your body might have a hard time fighting the infection.\n                \nIf severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death). In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation.\n                \nIf you have P.A.D., your risk of heart disease and heart attack is higher than the risk for people who dont have P.A.D.\n                \nSmoking even one or two cigarettes a day can interfere with P.A.D. treatments. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications, including gangrene in the leg from decreased blood flow.\n                \nSecondhand Smoke Risks\n                \nSecondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. Secondhand smoke also refers to smoke thats breathed out by a person who is smoking.\n                \nSecondhand smoke contains many of the same harmful chemicals that people inhale when they smoke. It can damage the heart and blood vessels of people who dont smoke in the same way that active smoking harms people who do smoke. Secondhand smoke greatly increases adults risk of heart attack and death.\n                \nSecondhand smoke also raises the risk of future coronary heart disease in children and teens because it:\n                \nDamages heart tissues\n                \nLowers HDL cholesterol\n                \nRaises blood pressure\n                \nThe risks of secondhand smoke are especially high for premature babies who have respiratory distress syndrome and children who have conditions such asasthma.\n                \nCigar and Pipe Smoke Risks\n                \nResearchers know less about how cigar and pipe smoke affects the heart and blood vessels than they do about cigarette smoke.\n                \nHowever, the smoke from cigars and pipes contains the same harmful chemicals as the smoke from cigarettes. Also, studies have shown that people who smoke cigars are at increased risk of heart disease."

            "question": "What is (are) Cystic Fibrosis ?",
            "answer": "Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat.\n                \n\"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves.\n                \nCF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected.\n                \nIf you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.)\n                \nThe buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs.\n                \nThe thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine.\n                \nThese enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort.\n                \nCF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh).\n                \nCF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.)\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years.\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often.\n                \nLung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF.\n                \nAs treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer.\n                \nEarly treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems."

            "question": "What causes Cystic Fibrosis ?",
            "answer": "A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat.\n                \nResearch suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF.\n                \nMore than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease.\n                \nHow Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited?\n                \nEvery person inherits two CFTR genesone from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF.\n                \nChildren who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\n                \nThe image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\n                \nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis"

Other times, your symptoms may become more severe.\n                \nOne of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born.\n                \nMost of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body.\n                \nCystic Fibrosis\n                \n\n                \nRespiratory System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPeople who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody.\n                \nPeople who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF.\n                \nPeople who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage.\n                \nAs CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis).\n                \nSome people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery.\n                \nDigestive System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nIn CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines.\n                \nAs a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort.\n                \nA hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins.\n                \nAs CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as:\n                \nPancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain.\n                \nRectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum.\n                \nLiver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts.\n                \nDiabetes.\n                \nGallstones.\n                \nReproductive System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nMen who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis.\n                \nWomen who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications.\n                \nOther Signs, Symptoms, and Complications\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood.\n                \nCF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\n                \nCF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n                \nLow bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia."

            "question": "How to diagnose Cystic Fibrosis ?",
            "answer": "Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests.\n                \nNewborn Screening\n                \nAll States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly.\n                \nSweat Test\n                \nIf a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat.\n                \nFor this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling.\n                \nSweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as:\n                \nGenetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF.\n                \nA chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air.\n                \nA sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF.\n                \nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\n                \nA sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment.\n                \nPrenatal Screening\n                \nIf you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS).\n                \nIn amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal.\n                \nIn CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF.\n                \nCystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing\n                \nPeople who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children.\n                \nIf you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier.\n                \nA genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases."

The goals of CF treatment include:\n                \nPreventing and controlling lung infections\n                \nLoosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs\n                \nPreventing or treating blockages in the intestines\n                \nProviding enough nutrition\n                \nPreventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body)\n                \nDepending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF.\n                \nOften, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers.\n                \nThe United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics.\n                \nFor more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page.\n                \nTreatment for Lung Problems\n                \nThe main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.\n                \nYou might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.\n                \nBreathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.\n                \nExercise\n                \nAerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.\n                \nHowever, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood.\n                \nIf you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older).\n                \nAntibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nOral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital.\n                \nAnti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.\n                \nBronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms.\n                \nTreatments for Advanced Lung Disease\n                \nIf you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask.\n                \nIf other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.\n                \nPulmonary Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\n                \nPR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:\n                \nExercise training\n                \nNutritional counseling\n                \nEducation on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it\n                \nEnergy-conserving techniques\n                \nBreathing strategies\n                \nPsychological counseling and/or group support\n                \nPR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.\n                \nTreatment for Digestive Problems\n                \nCF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children.\n                \nNutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs.\n                \nIn addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include:\n                \nOral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins.\n                \nSupplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb.\n                \nHigh-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients.\n                \nA high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising.\n                \nA feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep.\n                \nOther treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better.\n                \nTreatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications\n                \nA common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes.\n                \nAnother common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density."

            "question": "What is (are) Pulmonary Embolism ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE, is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. The blockage usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg.\n                \nA clot that forms in one part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to another part of the body is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus).\n                \nPE is a serious condition that can:\n                \nDamage part of your lung because of a lack of blood flow to your lung tissue. This damage may lead to pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries).\n                \nCause low oxygen levels in your blood.\n                \nDamage other organs in your body because of a lack of oxygen.\n                \nIf a blood clot is large, or if there are many clots, PE can cause death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPE most often is a complication of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In DVT, blood clots form in the deep veins of the bodymost often in the legs. These clots can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery.\n                \nDeep vein clots are not like clots in veins close to the skin's surface. Those clots remain in place and do not cause PE.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe exact number of people affected by DVT and PE isn't known. Estimates suggest these conditions affect 300,000 to 600,000 people in the United States each year.\n                \nIf left untreated, about 30 percent of patients who have PE will die. Most of those who die do so within the first few hours of the event.\n                \nThe good news is that a prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can save lives and help prevent the complications of PE."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Pulmonary Embolism? ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs equally in men and women. The risk increases with age. For every 10 years after age 60, the risk of having PE doubles.\n                \nCertain inherited conditions, such as factor V Leiden, increase the risk of blood clotting and PE.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nYour risk for PE is high if you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a history of DVT. In DVT, blood clots form in the deep veins of the bodymost often in the legs. These clots can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery.\n                \nYour risk for PE also is high if you've had the condition before.\n                \nOther Risk Factors\n                \nOther factors also can increase the risk for PE, such as:\n                \nBeing bedridden or unable to move around much\n                \nHaving surgery or breaking a bone (the risk goes up in the weeks following the surgery or injury)\n                \nHaving certain diseases or conditions, such as a stroke, paralysis (an inability to move), chronic heart disease, or high blood pressure\n                \nSmoking\n                \nPeople who have recently been treated for cancer or who have a central venous catheter are more likely to develop DVT, which increases their risk for PE. A central venous catheter is a tube placed in a vein to allow easy access to the bloodstream for medical treatment.\n                \nOther risk factors for DVT include sitting for long periods (such as during long car or airplane rides), pregnancy and the 6-week period after pregnancy, and being overweight or obese. Women who take hormone therapy pills or birth control pills also are at increased risk for DVT.\n                \nThe risk of developing blood clots increases as your number of risk factors increases."

            "question": "How to diagnose Pulmonary Embolism ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nDoctors who treat patients in the emergency room often are the ones to diagnose PE with the help of a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who deals with x rays and other similar tests.\n                \nMedical History and Physical Exam\n                \nTo diagnose PE, the doctor will ask about your medical history. He or she will want to: \n                \nFind out your deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE risk factors\n                \nSee how likely it is that you could have PE\n                \nRule out other possible causes for your symptoms\n                \nYour doctor also will do a physical exam. During the exam, he or she will check your legs for signs of DVT. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nMany tests can help diagnose PE. Which tests you have will depend on how you feel when you get to the hospital, your risk factors, available testing options, and other conditions you could possibly have. You may have one or more of the following tests.\n                \nUltrasound\n                \nDoctors can use ultrasound to look for blood clots in your legs. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check blood flow in your veins.\n                \nFor this test, gel is put on the skin of your legs. A hand-held device called a transducer is moved back and forth over the affected areas. The transducer gives off ultrasound waves and detects their echoes as they bounce off the vein walls and blood cells.\n                \nA computer turns the echoes into a picture on a computer screen, allowing the doctor to see blood flow in your legs. If the doctor finds blood clots in the deep veins of your legs, he or she will recommend treatment.\n                \nDVT and PE both are treated with the same medicines.\n                \nComputed Tomography Scans\n                \nDoctors can use computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scans, or CT scans, to look for blood clots in the lungs and legs.\n                \nFor this test, dye is injected into a vein in your arm. The dye makes the blood vessels in your lungs and legs show up on x-ray images. You'll lie on a table, and an x-ray tube will rotate around you. The tube will take pictures from many angles.\n                \nThis test allows doctors to detect most cases of PE. The test only takes a few minutes. Results are available shortly after the scan is done.\n                \nLung Ventilation/Perfusion Scan\n                \nA lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or VQ scan, uses a radioactive substance to show how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of your lungs. This test can help detect PE.\n                \nPulmonary Angiography\n                \nPulmonary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) is another test used to diagnose PE. This test isn't available at all hospitals, and a trained specialist must do the test.\n                \nFor this test, a flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the groin (upper thigh) or arm to the blood vessels in the lungs. Dye is injected into the blood vessels through the catheter.\n                \nX-ray pictures are taken to show blood flowing through the blood vessels in the lungs. If a blood clot is found, your doctor may use the catheter to remove it or deliver medicine to dissolve it.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nCertain blood tests may help your doctor find out whether you're likely to have PE.\n                \nA D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot breaks down. High levels of the substance may mean a clot is present. If your test is normal and you have few risk factors, PE isn't likely.\n                \nOther blood tests check for inherited disorders that cause blood clots. Blood tests also can measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A clot in a blood vessel in your lungs may lower the level of oxygen in your blood.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nTo rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, your doctor may use one or more of the following tests.\n                \nEchocardiography (echo). This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. Doctors use echo to check heart function and detect blood clots inside the heart.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\n                \nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of your lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs).\n                \nChest MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses radio waves and magnetic fields to create pictures of organs and structures inside the body. MRI often can provide more information than an x ray."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Pulmonary Embolism ?",
            "answer": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. The main goals of treating PE are to stop the blood clot from getting bigger and keep new clots from forming.\n                \nTreatment may include medicines to thin the blood and slow its ability to clot. If your symptoms are life threatening, your doctor may give you medicine to quickly dissolve the clot. Rarely, your doctor may use surgery or another procedure to remove the clot.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nAnticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants), or blood thinners, decrease your blood's ability to clot. They're used to stop blood clots from getting larger and prevent clots from forming. Blood thinners don't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most clots with time.)\n                \nYou can take blood thinners as either a pill, an injection, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection). Warfarin is given as a pill. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube.\n                \nYour doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once warfarin starts to work, heparin usually is stopped.\n                \nPregnant women usually are treated with heparin only, because warfarin is dangerous for the pregnancy.\n                \nIf you have deep vein thrombosis, treatment with blood thinners usually lasts for 3 to 6months. If you've had blood clots before, you may need a longer period of treatment. If you're being treated for another illness, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners as long as PE risk factors are present.\n                \nThe most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.\n                \nSometimes the bleeding is internal, which is why people treated with blood thinners usually have routine blood tests. These tests, called PT and PTT tests, measure the blood's ability to clot. These tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you're bruising or bleeding easily.\n                \nThrombin inhibitors are a newer type of blood-thinning medicine. They're used to treat some types of blood clots in people who can't take heparin.\n                \nEmergency Treatment\n                \nWhen PE is life threatening, a doctor may use treatments that remove or break up the blood clot. These treatments are given in an emergency room or hospital.\n                \nThrombolytics (THROM-bo-LIT-iks) are medicines that can quickly dissolve a blood clot. They're used to treat large clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations.\n                \nSometimes a doctor may use a catheter (a flexible tube) to reach the blood clot. The catheter is inserted into a vein in the groin (upper thigh) or arm and threaded to the clot in the lung. The doctor may use the catheter to remove the clot or deliver medicine to dissolve it.\n                \nRarely, surgery may be needed to remove the blood clot.\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nIf you can't take medicines to thin your blood, or if the medicines don't work, your doctor may suggest a vena cava filter. This device keeps blood clots from traveling to your lungs.\n                \nThe filter is inserted inside a large vein called the inferior vena cava. (This vein carries blood from the body back to the heart). The filter catches clots before they travel to the lungs. This type of treatment can prevent PE, but it won't stop other blood clots from forming.\n                \nGraduated compression stockings can reduce the chronic (ongoing) swelling that a blood clot in the leg may cause.\n                \nGraduated compression stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This causes gentle compression (pressure) up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting."

            "question": "What is (are) Hemolytic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their normal lifespan is over.\n                \nRed blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. These cells carry oxygen to your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body.\n                \nRed blood cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. They live for about 120 days in the bloodstream and then die.\n                \nWhite blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infections. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nWhen blood cells die, the body's bone marrow makes more blood cells to replace them. However, in hemolytic anemia, the bone marrow can't make red blood cells fast enough to meet the body's needs.\n                \nHemolytic anemia can lead to many health problems, such as fatigue (tiredness), pain, irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, and heart failure.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHemolytic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n                \nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction.\n                \nHemolytic anemia is caused by high rates of red blood cell destruction. Many diseases, conditions, and factors can cause the body to destroy its red blood cells.\n                \nThese causes can be inherited or acquired. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene(s) for the condition on to you. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of hemolytic anemia isn't known.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThere are many types of hemolytic anemia. Treatment and outlook depend on what type you have and how severe it is. The condition can develop suddenly or slowly. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\n                \nHemolytic anemia often can be successfully treated or controlled. Mild hemolytic anemia may need no treatment at all. Severe hemolytic anemia requires prompt and proper treatment, or it may be fatal.\n                \nInherited forms of hemolytic anemia are lifelong conditions that may require ongoing treatment. Acquired forms of hemolytic anemia may go away if the cause of the condition is found and corrected."

            "question": "What causes Hemolytic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "The immediate cause of hemolytic anemia is the early destruction of red blood cells. This means that red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their normal lifespan is over.\n                \nMany diseases, conditions, and factors can cause the body to destroy its red blood cells. These causes can be inherited or acquired. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it.\n                \nSometimes, the cause of hemolytic anemia isn't known.\n                \nFor more information about the specific causes of hemolytic anemia, go to \"Types of Hemolytic Anemia.\"\n                \nInherited Hemolytic Anemias\n                \nIn inherited hemolytic anemias, the genes that control how red blood cells are made are faulty. You can get a faulty red blood cell gene from one or both of your parents.\n                \nDifferent types of faulty genes cause different types of inherited hemolytic anemia. However, in each type, the body makes abnormal red blood cells. The problem with the red blood cells may involve the hemoglobin, cell membrane, or enzymes that maintain healthy red blood cells.\n                \nThe abnormal cells may be fragile and break down while moving through the bloodstream. If this happens, an organ called the spleen may remove the cell debris from the bloodstream.\n                \nAcquired Hemolytic Anemias\n                \nIn acquired hemolytic anemias, the body makes normal red blood cells. However, a disease, condition, or other factor destroys the cells. Examples of conditions that can destroy the red blood cells include:\n                \nImmune disorders\n                \nInfections\n                \nReactions to medicines or blood transfusions\n                \nHypersplenism (HI-per-SPLEEN-izm; an enlarged spleen)"

            "answer": "Hemolytic anemia can affect people of all ages and races and both sexes. Some types of hemolytic anemia are more likely to occur in certain populations than others.\n                \nFor example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency mostly affects males of African or Mediterranean descent. In the United States, the condition is more common among African Americans than Caucasians.\n                \nIn the United States, sickle cell anemia mainly affects African Americans."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Hemolytic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "The signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia will depend on the type and severity of the disease.\n                \nPeople who have mild hemolytic anemia often have no signs or symptoms. More severe hemolytic anemia may cause many signs and symptoms, and they may be serious.\n                \nMany of the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia apply to all types of anemia.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Anemia\n                \nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts.\n                \nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain.\n                \nA lack of red blood cells also means that your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Hemolytic Anemia\n                \nJaundice\n                \nJaundice refers to a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes. When red blood cells die, they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream.\n                \nThe hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin, which gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color. Bilirubin also causes urine to be dark yellow or brown.\n                \nPain in the Upper Abdomen\n                \nGallstones or an enlarged spleen may cause pain in the upper abdomen. High levels of bilirubin and cholesterol (from the breakdown of red blood cells) can form into stones in the gallbladder. These stones can be painful.\n                \nThe spleen is an organ in the abdomen that helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells. In hemolytic anemia, the spleen may be enlarged, which can be painful.\n                \nLeg Ulcers and Pain\n                \nIn people who have sickle cell anemia, the sickle-shaped cells can clog small blood vessels and block blood flow. This can cause leg sores and pain throughout the body.\n                \nA Severe Reaction to a Blood Transfusion\n                \nYou may develop hemolytic anemia due to a blood transfusion. This can happen if the transfused blood is a different blood type than your blood.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of a severe reaction to a transfusion include fever, chills, low blood pressure, and shock. (Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs if the body isn't getting enough blood flow.)"

            "question": "How to diagnose Hemolytic Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose hemolytic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nPrimary care doctors, such as a family doctor or pediatrician, may help diagnose and treat hemolytic anemia. Your primary care doctor also may refer you to a hematologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders.\n                \nDoctors and clinics that specialize in treating inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemias, also may be involved.\n                \nIf your hemolytic anemia is inherited, you may want to consult a genetic counselor. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has the condition. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nTo find the cause and severity of hemolytic anemia, your doctor may ask detailed questions about your symptoms, personal medical history, and your family medical history.\n                \nHe or she may ask whether:\n                \nYou or anyone in your family has had problems with anemia\n                \nYou've recently had any illnesses or medical conditions\n                \nYou take any medicines, and which ones\n                \nYou've been exposed to certain chemicals or substances\n                \nYou have an artificial heart valve or other medical device that could damage your red blood cells\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of hemolytic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the condition is and what's causing it.\n                \nThe exam may include:\n                \nChecking for jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\n                \nListening to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats\n                \nListening for rapid or uneven breathing\n                \nFeeling your abdomen to check the size of your spleen\n                \nDoing a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nMany tests are used to diagnose hemolytic anemia. These tests can help confirm a diagnosis, look for a cause, and find out how severe the condition is.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\n                \nThis test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\n                \nThe normal range of these levels may vary in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, a different blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\n                \nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia.\n                \nOther Blood Tests\n                \nIf the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is.\n                \nReticulocyte count. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate.\n                \nPeople who have hemolytic anemia usually have high reticulocyte counts because their bone marrow is working hard to replace the destroyed red blood cells.\n                \nPeripheral smear. For this test, your doctor will look at your red blood cells through a microscope. Some types of hemolytic anemia change the normal shape of red blood cells.\n                \nCoombs' test. This test can show whether your body is making antibodies (proteins) to destroy red blood cells.\n                \nHaptoglobin, bilirubin, and liver function tests. When red blood cells break down, they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The hemoglobin combines with a chemical called haptoglobin. A low level of haptoglobin in the bloodstream is a sign of hemolytic anemia.\n                \nHemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream may be a sign of hemolytic anemia. High levels of this compound also occur with some liver and gallbladder diseases. Thus, you may need liver function tests to find out what's causing the high bilirubin levels.\n                \nHemoglobin electrophoresis. This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. It can help diagnose the type of anemia you have.\n                \nTesting for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In PNH, the red blood cells are missing certain proteins. The test for PNH can detect red blood cells that are missing these proteins.\n                \nOsmotic fragility test. This test looks for red blood cells that are more fragile than normal. These cells may be a sign of hereditary spherocytosis (an inherited type of hemolytic anemia).\n                \nTesting for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In G6PD deficiency, the red blood cells are missing an important enzyme called G6PD. The test for G6PD deficiency looks for this enzyme in a sample of blood.\n                \nUrine Test\n                \nA urine test will look for the presence of free hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen in the blood) and iron.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nFor a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. The sample is examined under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\n                \nA bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. The tissue is examined to check the number and type of cells in the bone marrow.\n                \nYou may not need bone marrow tests if blood tests show what's causing your hemolytic anemia.\n                \nTests for Other Causes of Anemia\n                \nBecause anemia has many causes, you may have tests for conditions such as:\n                \nKidney failure\n                \nLead poisoning\n                \nVitamin or iron deficiency\n                \nNewborn Testing for Sickle Cell Anemia and G6PD Deficiency\n                \nAll States mandate screening for sickle cell anemia as part of their newborn screening programs. Some States also mandate screening for G6PD deficiency. These inherited types of hemolytic anemia can be detected with routine blood tests.\n                \nDiagnosing these conditions as early as possible is important so that children can get proper treatment."

People who have severe hemolytic anemia usually need ongoing treatment. Severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal if it's not properly treated.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nThe goals of treating hemolytic anemia include:\n                \nReducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells\n                \nIncreasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level\n                \nTreating the underlying cause of the condition\n                \nTreatment will depend on the type, cause, and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have. Your doctor also will consider your age, overall health, and medical history.\n                \nIf you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia, it's a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment. If you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia, it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected.\n                \nBlood Transfusions\n                \nBlood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia.\n                \nA blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone, can stop your immune system from, or limit its ability to, make antibodies (proteins) against red blood cells.\n                \nIf you don't respond to corticosteroids, your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system. Examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine.\n                \nIf you have severe sickle cell anemia, your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea. This medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have.\n                \nIn people who have sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia.\n                \nPlasmapheresis\n                \nPlasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. For this procedure, blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein.\n                \nThe plasma, which contains the antibodies, is separated from the rest of the blood. Then, plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body.\n                \nThis treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia don't work.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSome people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens. The spleen is an organ in the abdomen. A healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells.\n                \nAn enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction.\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\n                \nIn some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia.\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).\n                \nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nIf you have AIHA with cold-reactive antibodies, try to avoid cold temperatures. This can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. It's very important to protect your fingers, toes, and ears from the cold.\n                \nTo protect yourself, you can:\n                \nWear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer.\n                \nWear a hat, scarf, and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather.\n                \nTurn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in air-conditioned spaces.\n                \nWarm up the car before driving in cold weather.\n                \nPeople born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia. For example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises)."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nA heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.\n                \nHeart attack treatment works best when its given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if youre not sure, call 911 right away.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIf the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.\n                \nHeart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery\n                \n\n                \nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.\n                \nHeart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias.\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.\n                \nDon't Wait--Get Help Quickly\n                \nActing fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart.

Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:\n                \nChest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.\n                \nUpper body discomfort.You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).\n                \nShortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.\n                \nOther possible symptoms of a heart attack include:\n                \nBreaking out in a cold sweat\n                \nFeeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)\n                \nNausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting\n                \nLight-headedness or sudden dizziness\n                \nAny sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)\n                \nNot all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.\n                \nQuick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911\n                \nIf you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care. Acting fast can save your life.\n                \nDo not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you.

The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIf the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.\n                \nCoronary Artery Spasm\n                \nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.\n                \nWhat causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to:\n                \nTaking certain drugs, such as cocaine\n                \nEmotional stress or pain\n                \nExposure to extreme cold\n                \nCigarette smoking"

            "question": "Who is at risk for Heart Attack? ?",
            "answer": "Certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and have a heart attack. You can control many of these risk factors.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can Control\n                \nThe major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol\n                \nOverweight and obesity\n                \nAn unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium)\n                \nLack of routine physical activity\n                \nHigh blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nSome of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome.\n                \nIn general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn't have metabolic syndrome.\n                \nFor more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the Health Topics Metabolic Syndrome article.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can't Control\n                \nRisk factors that you can't control include:\n                \nAge. The risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause).\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.\n                \nPreeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Heart Attack ?",
            "answer": "Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic.\n                \nThe symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts:\n                \nHeart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours.\n                \nPeople who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones.\n                \nThe most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort.\n                \nWomen are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw.\n                \nSome people don't have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks.\n                \nMost Common Symptoms\n                \nThe most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:\n                \nChest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe.\n                \nUpper body discomfort.You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).\n                \nShortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.\n                \nThe symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they're active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest.\n                \nChest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack.\n                \nAll chest pain should be checked by a doctor.\n                \nOther Common Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack:\n                \nBreaking out in a cold sweat\n                \nFeeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)\n                \nNausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting\n                \nLight-headedness or sudden dizziness\n                \nAny sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)\n                \nNot everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur.\n                \nThe more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack.\n                \nQuick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowlysometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack.\n                \nAny time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you're having a heart attack. Here's why:\n                \nActing fast can save your life.\n                \nAn ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.\n                \nThe 911 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you're not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life.\n                \nEvery minute matters. Never delay calling 911 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help."

            "question": "How to diagnose Heart Attack ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nDuring a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack.\n                \nCommonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CKMB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels.\n                \nIf your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure calledpercutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI), sometimes referred to ascoronary angioplasty(AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Attack ?",
            "answer": "Early treatment for a heart attack can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 911 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital.\n                \nImmediate Treatment\n                \nCertain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include:\n                \nAspirin to prevent further blood clotting\n                \nNitroglycerin to reduce your hearts workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries\n                \nOxygen therapy\n                \nTreatment for chest pain\n                \nOnce the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries.\n                \n\n                \nClot-Busting Medicines\n                \nThrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible.\n                \n\n                \nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure.\n                \nOther Treatments for Heart Attack\n                \nOther treatments for heart attack include:\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedical procedures\n                \nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes\n                \nCardiac rehabilitation\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines.\n                \nACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle.\n                \nAnticlotting medicines. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel.\n                \nAnticoagulants. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger.\n                \nBeta blockers. Beta blockers decrease your hearts workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\n                \nStatin medicines. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack orstroke.\n                \nYou also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias.Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\n                \n\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nCoronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle.\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nTreatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nTaking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack.\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nIf you eat:\n                \nTry to eat no more than:\n                \n1,200 calories a day               \n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day      \n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \n\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent another heart attack.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \n\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group.

            "question": "What is (are) Oxygen Therapy ?",
            "answer": "Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen, a gas that your body needs to work well. Normally, your lungs absorb oxygen from the air. However, some diseases and conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen.\n                \nOxygen therapy may help you function better and be more active. Oxygen is supplied in a metal cylinder or other container. It flows through a tube and is delivered to your lungs in one of the following ways:\n                \nThrough a nasal cannula, which consists of two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils.\n                \nThrough a face mask, which fits over your nose and mouth.\n                \nThrough a small tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck. Your doctor will use a needle or small incision (cut) to place the tube. Oxygen delivered this way is called transtracheal oxygen therapy.\n                \nOxygen therapy can be done in a hospital, another medical setting, or at home. If you need oxygen therapy for a chronic (ongoing) disease or condition, you might receive home oxygen therapy.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo learn how oxygen therapy works, it helps to understand how your respiratory system works. This system is a group of organs and tissues that help you breathe. The respiratory system includes the airways and lungs.\n                \nThe airways carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste gas) out of your lungs.\n                \nAir enters your body through your nose or mouth, which moistens and warms the air. The air then travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe divides into two tubes called bronchi that enter your lungs.\n                \nWithin your lungs, your bronchi branch into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles (BRONG-ke-ols). These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nEach of the air sacs is covered in a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees). The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood throughout your body.\n                \nWhen air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries.\n                \nThe oxygen-rich blood then travels to the heart through the pulmonary vein and its branches. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to your organs. (For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.)\n                \nCertain acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing) diseases and conditions can affect the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli into the blood. Examples include pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n                \nYour doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on the results of tests, such as an arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test. These tests measure how much oxygen is in your blood. A low oxygen level is a sign that you need oxygen therapy.\n                \nOxygen is considered a medicine, so your doctor must prescribe it.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nOxygen therapy helps many people function better and be more active. It also may help:\n                \nDecrease shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness)\n                \nImprove sleep in some people who have sleep-related breathing disorders\n                \nIncrease the lifespan of some people who have COPD\n                \nAlthough you may need oxygen therapy long term, it doesn't have to limit your daily routine. Portable oxygen units can make it easier for you to move around and do many daily activities. Talk with your doctor if you have questions about whether certain activities are safe for you.\n                \nA home equipment provider will work with you to make sure you have the supplies and equipment you need. Trained staff also will show you how to use the equipment correctly and safely.\n                \nOxygen therapy generally is safe, but it can pose a fire hazard. To use your oxygen safely, follow the instructions you receive from your home equipment provider."

An arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test can measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.\n                \nFor an arterial blood gas test, a small needle is inserted into an artery, usually in your wrist. A sample of blood is taken from the artery. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen level is measured.\n                \nFor a pulse oximetry test, a small sensor is attached to your fingertip or toe. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\n                \nIf the tests show that your blood oxygen level is low, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. In the prescription, your doctor will include the number of liters of oxygen per minute that you need (oxygen flow rate). He or she also will include how often you need to use the oxygen (frequency of use).\n                \nFrequency of use includes when and for how long you should use the oxygen. Depending on your condition and blood oxygen level, you may need oxygen only at certain times, such as during sleep or while exercising.\n                \nIf your doctor prescribes home oxygen therapy, he or she can help you find a home equipment provider.

            "question": "What is (are) Respiratory Distress Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a breathing disorder that affects newborns. RDS rarely occurs in full-term infants. The disorder is more common in premature infants born about 6 weeks or more before their due dates.\n                \nRDS is more common in premature infants because their lungs aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant). Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that infants can breathe in air once they're born.\n                \nWithout enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and other organs if proper treatment isn't given.\n                \nMost babies who develop RDS show signs of breathing problems and a lack of oxygen at birth or within the first few hours that follow.\n                \nOverview\n                \nRDS is a common lung disorder in premature infants. In fact, nearly all infants born before 28 weeks of pregnancy develop RDS.\n                \nRDS might be an early phase of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (brong-ko-PUL-mo-nar-e dis-PLA-ze-ah), or BPD. This is another breathing disorder that affects premature babies.\n                \nRDS usually develops in the first 24 hours after birth. If premature infants still have breathing problems by the time they reach their original due dates, they may be diagnosed with BPD. Some of the life-saving treatments used for RDS may cause BPD.\n                \nSome infants who have RDS recover and never get BPD. Infants who do get BPD have lungs that are less developed or more damaged than the infants who recover.\n                \nInfants who develop BPD usually have fewer healthy air sacs and tiny blood vessels in their lungs. Both the air sacs and the tiny blood vessels that support them are needed to breathe well.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nDue to improved treatments and medical advances, most infants who have RDS survive. However, these babies may need extra medical care after going home.\n                \nSome babies have complications from RDS or its treatments. Serious complications include chronic (ongoing) breathing problems, such as asthma and BPD; blindness; and brain damage."

There they receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.\n                \nThe most important treatments for RDS are:\n                \nSurfactant replacement therapy.\n                \nBreathing support from a ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machine. These machines help premature infants breathe better.\n                \nOxygen therapy.\n                \nSurfactant Replacement Therapy\n                \nSurfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\n                \nBabies who have RDS are given surfactant until their lungs are able to start making the substance on their own. Surfactant usually is given through a breathing tube. The tube allows the surfactant to go directly into the baby's lungs.\n                \nOnce the surfactant is given, the breathing tube is connected to a ventilator, or the baby may get breathing support from NCPAP.\n                \nSurfactant often is given right after birth in the delivery room to try to prevent or treat RDS. It also may be given several times in the days that follow, until the baby is able to breathe better.\n                \nSome women are given medicines called corticosteroids during pregnancy. These medicines can speed up surfactant production and lung development in a fetus. Even if you had these medicines, your infant may still need surfactant replacement therapy after birth.\n                \nBreathing Support\n                \nInfants who have RDS often need breathing support until their lungs start making enough surfactant. Until recently, a mechanical ventilator usually was used. The ventilator was connected to a breathing tube that ran through the infant's mouth or nose into the windpipe.\n                \nToday, more and more infants are receiving breathing support from NCPAP. NCPAP gently pushes air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the infant's nostrils.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nInfants who have breathing problems may get oxygen therapy. Oxygen is given through a ventilator or NCPAP machine, or through a tube in the nose. This treatment ensures that the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments for RDS include medicines, supportive therapy, and treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is a condition that affects some premature infants.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nDoctors often give antibiotics to infants who have RDS to control infections (if the doctors suspect that an infant has an infection).\n                \nSupportive Therapy\n                \nTreatment in the NICU helps limit stress on babies and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Such treatment may include:\n                \nUsing a radiant warmer or incubator to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.\n                \nOngoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.\n                \nUsing sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.\n                \nGiving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins.

            "answer": "Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. These steps include:\n                \nSeeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet\n                \nAvoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs\n                \nManaging any medical conditions you have\n                \nPreventing infections\n                \nIf you're having a planned cesarean delivery (C-section), your doctor can do tests before delivery to show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. These tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity.\n                \nYour doctor may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine if he or she thinks you may give birth too early. This medicine can speed up surfactant production and development of the lungs, brain, and kidneys in your baby.\n                \nTreatment with corticosteroids can reduce your baby's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If the baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild.\n                \nCorticosteroid treatment also can reduce the chances that your baby will have bleeding in the brain."

            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nSarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) is a disease of unknown cause that leads to inflammation. This disease affects your bodys organs.\n                \nNormally, your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances. For example, it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger.\n                \nThese cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance. Inflammation occurs during this process. Once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away.\n                \nIn people who have sarcoidosis, the inflammation doesn't go away. Instead, some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas (gran-yu-LO-mas) in various organs in your body.\n                \nOverview\n                \nSarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. However, it's more likely to affect some organs than others. The disease usually starts in the lungs, skin, and/or lymph nodes (especially the lymph nodes in your chest).\n                \nAlso, the disease often affects the eyes and liver. Although less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain, leading to serious complications.\n                \nIf many granulomas form in an organ, they can affect how the organ works. This can cause signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. Many people who have sarcoidosis have no signs or symptoms or mild ones.\n                \nLofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that is typical in some people who have sarcoidosis. Lofgren's syndrome may cause fever, enlarged lymph nodes, arthritis (usually in the ankles), and/or erythema nodosum (er-ih-THE-ma no-DO-sum).\n                \nErythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch.\n                \nTreatment for sarcoidosis varies depending on which organs are affected. Your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease. Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe outlook for sarcoidosis varies. Many people recover from the disease with few or no long-term problems.\n                \nMore than half of the people who have sarcoidosis have remission within 3 years of diagnosis. Remission means the disease isn't active, but it can return.\n                \nTwo-thirds of people who have the disease have remission within 10 years of diagnosis. People who have Lofgren's syndrome usually have remission. Relapse (return of the disease) 1 or more years after remission occurs in less than 5 percent of patients.\n                \nSarcoidosis leads to organ damage in about one-third of the people diagnosed with the disease. Damage may occur over many years and involve more than one organ. Rarely, sarcoidosis can be fatal. Death usually is the result of problems with the lungs, heart, or brain.\n                \nPoor outcomes are more likely in people who have advanced disease and show little improvement from treatment.\n                \nCertain people are at higher risk for poor outcomes from chronic (long-term) sarcoidosis. This includes people who have lung scarring, heart or brain complications, or lupus pernio (LU-pus PUR-ne-o). Lupus pernio is a serious skin condition that sarcoidosis may cause.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis."

Often, the disease is found when a chest x ray is done for another reason (for example, to diagnose pneumonia).\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Signs and symptoms also may vary depending on your gender, age, and ethnic background. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Sarcoidosis?\")\n                \nCommon Signs and Symptoms\n                \nIn both adults and children, sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs. If granulomas (inflamed lumps) form in your lungs, you may wheeze, cough, feel short of breath, or have chest pain. Or, you may have no symptoms at all.\n                \nSome people who have sarcoidosis feel very tired, uneasy, or depressed. Night sweats and weight loss are common symptoms of the disease.\n                \nCommon signs and symptoms in children are fatigue (tiredness), loss of appetite, weight loss, bone and joint pain, and anemia.\n                \nChildren who are younger than 4 years old may have a distinct form of sarcoidosis. It may cause enlarged lymph nodes in the chest (which can be seen on chest x-ray pictures), skin lesions, and eye swelling or redness.\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms\n                \nSarcoidosis may affect your lymph nodes. The disease can cause enlarged lymph nodes that feel tender. Sarcoidosis usually affects the lymph nodes in your neck and chest. However, the disease also may affect the lymph nodes under your chin, in your armpits, or in your groin.\n                \nSarcoidosis can cause lumps, ulcers (sores), or areas of discolored skin. These areas may itch, but they don't hurt. These signs tend to appear on your back, arms, legs, and scalp. Sometimes they appear near your nose or eyes. These signs usually last a long time.\n                \nSarcoidosis may cause a more serious skin condition called lupus pernio. Disfiguring skin sores may affect your nose, nasal passages, cheeks, ears, eyelids, and fingers. These sores tend to be ongoing. They can return after treatment is over.\n                \nSarcoidosis also can cause eye problems. If you have sarcoidosis, having an annual eye exam is important. If you have changes in your vision and can't see as clearly or can't see color, call 911 or have someone drive you to the emergency room.\n                \nYou should call your doctor if you have any new eye symptoms, such as burning, itching, tearing, pain, or sensitivity to light.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of sarcoidosis also may include an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands.\n                \nAlthough less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain. This can cause many symptoms, such as abnormal heartbeats, shortness of breath, headaches, and vision problems.

            "question": "How to diagnose Sarcoidosis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. Your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. For example, he or she may ask whether you:\n                \nHave a family history of sarcoidosis.\n                \nHave had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease.\n                \nHave ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (This type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.)\n                \nHave had contact with organic dust from birds or hay.\n                \nExposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. However, these lumps are signs of other conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. Tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nYour doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs.\n                \nUsually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin.\n                \nIf this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nThe substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures.\n                \nIf lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.)\n                \nOther Tests To Assess Organ Damage\n                \nYou also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram).\n                \nIf youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. In sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms."

Whether you need treatment and what type of treatment you need depend on your signs and symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well.\n                \nIf the disease affects certain organssuch as your eyes, heart, or brainyou'll need treatment even if you don't have any symptoms.\n                \nIn either case, whether you have symptoms or not, you should see your doctor for ongoing care. He or she will want to check to make sure that the disease isn't damaging your organs. For example, you may need routine lung function tests to make sure that your lungs are working well.\n                \nIf the disease isn't worsening, your doctor may watch you closely to see whether the disease goes away on its own. If the disease does start to get worse, your doctor can prescribe treatment.\n                \nThe goals of treatment include:\n                \nRelieving symptoms\n                \nImproving organ function\n                \nControlling inflammation and reducing the size of granulomas (inflamed lumps)\n                \nPreventing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) if your lungs are affected\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nPrednisone\n                \nPrednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment for sarcoidosis. This medicine reduces inflammation. In most people, prednisone relieves symptoms within a couple of months.\n                \nAlthough most people need to take prednisone for 12 months or longer, your doctor may lower the dose within a few months after you start the medicine.\n                \nLong-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Work with your doctor to decide whether the benefits of this medicine outweigh the risks. If your doctor prescribes this treatment, he or she will find the lowest dose that controls your disease.\n                \nWhen you stop taking prednisone, you should cut back slowly (as your doctor advises). This will help prevent flareups of sarcoidosis. Cutting back slowly also allows your body to adjust to not having the medicine.\n                \nIf a relapse or flareup occurs after you stop taking prednisone, you may need a second round of treatment. If you remain stable for more than 1 year after stopping this treatment, the risk of relapse is low.\n                \nOther Medicines\n                \nOther medicines, besides prednisone, also are used to treat sarcoidosis. Examples include:\n                \nHydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (known as antimalarial medicines). These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects the skin or brain. Your doctor also may prescribe an antimalarial if you have a high level of calcium in your blood due to sarcoidosis.\n                \nMedicines that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or leflunomide. These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects your lungs, eyes, skin, or joints.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe these medicines if your sarcoidosis worsens while you're taking prednisone or if you can't handle prednisone's side effects.\n                \nIf you have Lofgren's syndrome with pain or fever, your doctor may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.\n                \nIf you're wheezing and coughing, you may need inhaled medicine to help open your airways. You take inhaled medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs.\n                \nAnti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, originally developed to treat arthritis, are being studied to treat sarcoidosis.\n                \nOngoing Research\n                \nResearchers continue to look for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis. They're currently studying treatments aimed at the immune system. Researchers also are studying antibiotics as a possible treatment for sarcoidosis that affects the skin.\n                \nFor more information about ongoing research, go to the Clinical Trials section of this article."

            "question": "What is (are) Sickle Cell Disease ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nThe term sickle cell disease (SCD) describes a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. People with SCD have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells.\n                \nHemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.\n                \nInherited means that the disease is passed by genes from parents to their children. SCD is not contagious. A person cannot catch it, like a cold or infection, from someone else.\n                \nPeople who have SCD inherit two abnormal hemoglobin genes, one from each parent. In all forms of SCD, at least one of the two abnormal genes causes a persons body to make hemoglobin S. When a person has two hemoglobin S genes, Hemoglobin SS, the disease is called sickle cell anemia. This is the most common and often most severe kind of SCD.\n                \nHemoglobin SC disease and hemoglobin S thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) are two other common forms of SCD.\n                \nSome Forms of Sickle Cell Disease\n                \nHemoglobin SS\n                \nHemoglobin SC\n                \nHemoglobin S0 thalassemia\n                \nHemoglobin S+ thalassemia\n                \nHemoglobin SD\n                \nHemoglobin SE\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nCells in tissues need a steady supply of oxygen to work well. Normally, hemoglobin in red blood cells takes up oxygen in the lungs and carries it to all the tissues of the body.\n                \nRed blood cells that contain normal hemoglobin are disc shaped (like a doughnut without a hole). This shape allows the cells to be flexible so that they can move through large and small blood vessels to deliver oxygen.\n                \nSickle hemoglobin is not like normal hemoglobin. It can form stiff rods within the red cell, changing it into a crescent, or sickle shape.\n                \nSickle-shaped cells are not flexible and can stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen cant reach nearby tissues.\n                \nNormal Red Cells and Sickle Red Cells\n                \n\n                \nThe lack of tissue oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These pain attacks can occur without warning, and a person often needs to go to the hospital for effective treatment.\n                \nMost children with SCD are pain free between painful crises, but adolescents and adults may also suffer with chronic ongoing pain.\n                \nThe red cell sickling and poor oxygen delivery can also cause organ damage. Over a lifetime, SCD can harm a persons spleen, brain, eyes, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, penis, joints, bones, or skin.\n                \nSickle cells cant change shape easily, so they tend to burst apart or hemolyze. Normal red blood cells live about 90 to 120 days, but sickle cells last only 10 to 20 days.\n                \nThe body is always making new red blood cells to replace the old cells; however, in SCD the body may have trouble keeping up with how fast the cells are being destroyed. Because of this, the number of red blood cells is usually lower than normal. This condition, called anemia, can make a person have less energy.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nSickle cell disease is a life-long illness. The severity of the disease varies widely from person to person.\n                \nIn high-income countries like the United States, the life expectancy of a person with SCD is now about 4060 years. In 1973, the average lifespan of a person with SCD in the United States was only 14 years. Advances in the diagnosis and care of SCD have made this improvement possible.\n                \nAt the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. Unfortunately, most people with SCD are either too old for a transplant or dont have a relative who is a good enough genetic match for them to act as a donor. A well-matched donor is needed to have the best chance for a successful transplant.\n                \nThere are effective treatments that can reduce symptoms and prolong life. Early diagnosis and regular medical care to prevent complications also contribute to improved well-being."

            "answer": "Abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, causes sickle cell disease (SCD).\n                \nThe problem in hemoglobin S is caused by a small defect in the gene that directs the production of the beta globin part of hemoglobin. This small defect in the beta globin gene causes a problem in the beta globin part of hemoglobin, changing the way that hemoglobin works. (See Overview.)\n                \n\n                \nHow Is Sickle Cell Disease Inherited?\n                \nWhen the hemoglobin S gene is inherited from only one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene is inherited from the other, a person will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy.\n                \nOnly rarely do people with sickle cell trait have complications similar to those seen in people with SCD. But people with sickle cell trait are carriers of a defective hemoglobin S gene. So, they can pass it on when they have a child.\n                \nIf the childs other parent also has sickle cell trait or another abnormal hemoglobin gene (like thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D, hemoglobin E), that child has a chance of having SCD.\n                \nExample of an Inheritance Pattern\n                \n\n                \nIn the image above, each parent has one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene, and each of their children has:\n                \nA 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal genes: In this case the child does not have sickle cell trait or disease. (Case 1)\n                \nA 50 percent chance of inheriting one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene: This child has sickle cell trait. (Cases 2 and 3)\n                \nA 25 percent chance of inheriting two hemoglobin S genes: This child has sickle cell disease. (Case 4)\n                \nIt is important to keep in mind that each time this couple has a child, the chances of that child having sickle cell disease remain the same. In other words, if the first-born child has sickle cell disease, there is still a 25 percent chance that the second child will also have the disease. Both boys and girls can inherit sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease, or normal hemoglobin.\n                \nIf a person wants to know if he or she carries a sickle hemoglobin gene, a doctor can order a blood test to find out."

            "answer": "In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are of African ancestry or identify themselves as black.\n                \nAbout 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait.\n                \nAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease.\n                \nThere are also many people with this disease who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.\n                \nApproximately 100,000 Americans have SCD."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease ?",
            "answer": "Early Signs and Symptoms\n                \nIf a person has sickle cell disease (SCD), it is present at birth. But most infants do not have any problems from the disease until they are about 5 or 6 months of age. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories requires that all newborn babies receive screening for SCD. When a child has SCD, parents are notified before the child has symptoms.\n                \nSome children with SCD will start to have problems early on, and some later. Early symptoms of SCD may include:\n                \nPainful swelling of the hands and feet, known as dactylitis\n                \nFatigue or fussiness from anemia\n                \nA yellowish color of the skin, known as jaundice, or whites of the eyes, known as icteris, that occurs when a large number of red cells hemolyze\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of SCD will vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease.\n                \nMajor Complications of Sickle Cell Disease\n                \nAcute Pain (Sickle Cell or Vaso-occlusive) Crisis\n                \nPain episodes (crises) can occur without warning when sickle cells block blood flow and decrease oxygen delivery. People describe this pain as sharp, intense, stabbing, or throbbing. Severe crises can be even more uncomfortable than post-surgical pain or childbirth.\n                \nPain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time. But the pain often occurs in the\n                \nLower back\n                \nLegs\n                \nArms\n                \nAbdomen\n                \nChest\n                \nA crisis can be brought on by\n                \nIllness\n                \nTemperature changes\n                \nStress\n                \nDehydration (not drinking enough)\n                \nBeing at high altitudes\n                \nBut often a person does not know what triggers, or causes, the crisis. (See acute pain management.)\n                \nChronic Pain\n                \nMany adolescents and adults with SCD suffer from chronic pain. This kind of pain has been hard for people to describe, but it is usually different from crisis pain or the pain that results from organ damage.\n                \nChronic pain can be severe and can make life difficult. Its cause is not well understood. (See chronic pain management.)\n                \nSevere Anemia\n                \nPeople with SCD usually have mild to moderate anemia. At times, however, they can have severe anemia. Severe anemia can be life threatening. Severe anemia in an infant or child with SCD may be caused by:\n                \nSplenic sequestration crisis. The spleen is an organ that is located in the upper left side of the belly. The spleen filters germs in the blood, breaks up blood cells, and makes a kind of white blood cell. A splenic sequestration crisis occurs when red blood cells get stuck in the spleen, making it enlarge quickly. Since the red blood cells are trapped in the spleen, there are fewer cells to circulate in the blood. This causes severe anemia.  A big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\n                \nA big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\n                \nAplastic crisis. This crisis is usually caused by a parvovirus B19 infection, also called fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome. Parvovirus B19 is a very common infection, but in SCD it can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red cells for a while, leading to severe anemia.\n                \nSplenic sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis most commonly occur in infants and children with SCD. Adults with SCD may also experience episodes of severe anemia, but these usually have other causes.\n                \nNo matter the cause, severe anemia may lead to symptoms that include:\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nBeing very tired\n                \nFeeling dizzy\n                \nHaving pale skin\n                \nBabies and infants with severe anemia may feed poorly and seem very sluggish. (See anemia management.)\n                \nInfections\n                \nThe spleen is important for protection against certain kinds of germs. Sickle cells can damage the spleen and weaken or destroy its function early in life.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have damaged spleens are at risk for serious bacterial infections that can be life-threatening. Some of these bacteria include:\n                \nPneumococcus\n                \nHemophilus influenza type B\n                \nMeningococcus\n                \nSalmonella\n                \nStaphylococcus\n                \nChlamydia\n                \nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n                \nBacteria can cause:\n                \nBlood infection (septicemia)\n                \nLung infection (pneumonia)\n                \nInfection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n                \nBone infection (osteomyelitis)\n                \n(See how to prevent infections and infection management.)\n                \nAcute Chest Syndrome\n                \nSickling in blood vessels of the lungs can deprive a persons lungs of oxygen. When this happens, areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly. This condition is known as acute chest syndrome. In acute chest syndrome, at least one segment of the lung is damaged.\n                \nThis condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital.\n                \nAcute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins. A lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome.\n                \nSymptoms may include:\n                \nChest pain\n                \nFever\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nRapid breathing\n                \nCough\n                \n(See acute chest syndrome management.)\n                \nBrain Complications\n                \nClinical Stroke\n                \nA stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked to a part of the brain. When this happens, brain cells can be damaged or can die. In SCD, a clinical stroke means that a person shows outward signs that something is wrong. The symptoms depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms of stroke may include:\n                \nWeakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body\n                \nTrouble speaking, walking, or understanding\n                \nLoss of balance\n                \nSevere headache\n                \nAs many as 24 percent of people with hemoglobin SS and 10 percent of people with hemoglobin SC may suffer a clinical stroke by age 45.\n                \nIn children, clinical stroke occurs most commonly between the ages of 2 and 9, but recent prevention strategies have lowered the risk. (See Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening) and Red Blood Cell Transfusions.)\n                \nWhen people with SCD show symptoms of stroke, their families or friends should call 9-1-1 right away. (See clinical stroke management.)\n                \nSilent Stroke and Thinking Problems\n                \nBrain imaging and tests of thinking (cognitive studies) have shown that children and adults with hemoglobin SS and hemoglobin S0 thalassemia often have signs of silent brain injury, also called silent stroke. Silent brain injury is damage to the brain without showing outward signs of stroke.\n                \nThis injury is common. Silent brain injury can lead to learning problems or trouble making decisions or holding down a job. (See Cognitive Screening and silent stroke management.)\n                \nEye Problems\n                \nSickle cell disease can injure blood vessels in the eye.\n                \nThe most common site of damage is the retina, where blood vessels can overgrow, get blocked, or bleed. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain.\n                \nDetachment of the retina can occur. When the retina detaches, it is lifted or pulled from its normal position. These problems can cause visual impairment or loss. (See Eye Examinations.)\n                \nHeart Disease\n                \nPeople with SCD can have problems with blood vessels in the heart and with heart function. The heart can become enlarged. People can also develop pulmonary hypertension.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may also have heart damage from iron overload. (See transfusion management.)\n                \nPulmonary Hypertension\n                \nIn adolescents and adults, injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them. This causes the pressure in lung blood vessels to rise. High pressure in these blood vessels is called pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and fatigue.\n                \nWhen this condition is severe, it has been associated with a higher risk of death. (See screening for pulmonary hypertension.)\n                \nKidney Problems\n                \nThe kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling.\n                \nSCD causes the kidneys to have trouble making the urine as concentrated as it should be. This may lead to a need to urinate often and to have bedwetting or uncontrolled urination during the night (nocturnal enuresis). This often starts in childhood. Other problems may include:\n                \nBlood in the urine\n                \nDecreased kidney function\n                \nKidney disease\n                \nProtein loss in the urine\n                \nPriapism\n                \nMales with SCD can have unwanted, sometimes prolonged, painful erections. This condition is called priapism.\n                \nPriapism happens when blood flow out of the erect penis is blocked by sickled cells. If it goes on for a long period of time, priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence.\n                \nIf priapism lasts for more than 4 hours, emergency medical care should be sought to avoid complications. (See priapism management.)\n                \nGallstones\n                \nWhen red cells hemolyze, they release hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gets broken down into a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin can form stones that get stuck in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, sac-shaped organ beneath the liver that helps with digestion. Gallstones are a common problem in SCD.\n                \nGallstones may be formed early on but may not produce symptoms for years. When symptoms develop, they may include:\n                \nRight-sided upper belly pain\n                \nNausea\n                \nVomiting\n                \nIf problems continue or recur, a person may need surgery to remove the gallbladder.\n                \nLiver Complications\n                \nThere are a number of ways in which the liver may be injured in SCD.\n                \nSickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is an uncommon, but severe, form of liver damage that occurs when sickled red cells block blood vessels in the liver. This blockage prevents enough oxygen from reaching liver tissue.\n                \nThese episodes are usually sudden and may recur. Children often recover, but some adults may have chronic problems that lead to liver failure.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may develop liver damage from iron overload.\n                \nLeg Ulcers\n                \nSickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and then get larger and larger.\n                \nThe number of ulcers can vary from one to many. Some ulcers will heal quickly, but others may not heal and may last for long periods of time. Some ulcers come back after healing.\n                \nPeople with SCD usually dont get ulcers until after the age of 10.\n                \nJoint Complications\n                \nSickling in the bones of the hip and, less commonly, the shoulder joints, knees, and ankles, can decrease oxygen flow and result in severe damage. This damage is a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis. This disease is usually found in adolescents and adults.\n                \nSymptoms include pain and problems with walking and joint movement. A person may need pain medicines, surgery, or joint replacement if symptoms persist.\n                \nDelayed Growth and Puberty\n                \nChildren with SCD may grow and develop more slowly than their peers because of anemia. They will reach full sexual maturity, but this may be delayed.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nPregnancies in women with SCD can be risky for both the mother and the baby.\n                \nMothers may have medical complications including:\n                \nInfections\n                \nBlood clots\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nIncreased pain episodes\n                \nThey are also at higher risk for:\n                \nMiscarriages\n                \nPremature births\n                \nSmall-for-dates babies or underweight babies\n                \n(See pregnancy management.)\n                \nMental Health\n                \nAs in other chronic diseases, people with SCD may feel sad and frustrated at times. The limitations that SCD can impose on a persons daily activities may cause them to feel isolated from others. Sometimes they become depressed.\n                \nPeople with SCD may also have trouble coping with pain and fatigue, as well as with frequent medical visits and hospitalizations.

            "question": "How to diagnose Sickle Cell Disease ?",
            "answer": "Screening Tests\n                \nPeople who do not know whether they make sickle hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) or another abnormal hemoglobin (such as C,  thalassemia, E) can find out by having their blood tested. This way, they can learn whether they carry a gene (i.e., have the trait) for an abnormal hemoglobin that they could pass on to a child.\n                \nWhen each parent has this information, he or she can be better informed about the chances of having a child with some type of sickle cell disease (SCD), such as hemoglobin SS, SC, S thalassemia, or others.\n                \nNewborn Screening\n                \nWhen a child has SCD, it is very important to diagnose it early to better prevent complications.\n                \nEvery state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories require that every baby is tested for SCD as part of a newborn screening program.\n                \nIn newborn screening programs, blood from a heel prick is collected in spots on a special paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then analyzed in special labs.\n                \nNewborn screening results are sent to the doctor who ordered the test and to the childs primary doctor.\n                \nIf a baby is found to have SCD, health providers from a special follow-up newborn screening group contact the family directly to make sure that the parents know the results. The child is always retested to be sure that the diagnosis is correct.\n                \nNewborn screening programs also find out whether the baby has an abnormal hemoglobin trait. If so, parents are informed, and counseling is offered.\n                \nRemember that when a child has sickle cell trait or SCD, a future sibling, or the childs own future child, may be at risk. These possibilities should be discussed with the primary care doctor, a blood specialist called a hematologist, and/or a genetics counselor.\n                \nPrenatal Screening\n                \nDoctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. This is done using a sample of amniotic fluid, the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo, or tissue taken from the placenta, the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb.\n                \nTesting before birth can be done as early as 810 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin."

            "answer": "Health Maintenance To Prevent Complications\n                \nBabies with sickle cell disease (SCD) should be referred to a doctor or provider group that has experience taking care of people with this disease. The doctor might be a hematologist (a doctor with special training in blood diseases) or an experienced general pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner.\n                \nFor infants, the first SCD visit should take place before 8 weeks of age.\n                \nIf someone was born in a country that doesnt perform newborn SCD screening, he or she might be diagnosed with SCD later in childhood. These people should also be referred as soon as possible for special SCD care.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nExamining the person\n                \nGiving medicines and immunizations\n                \nPerforming tests\n                \nEducating families about the disease and what to watch out for\n                \n\n                \nPreventing Infection\n                \nIn SCD, the spleen doesnt work properly or doesnt work at all. This problem makes people with SCD more likely to get severe infections.\n                \nPenicillin\n                \nIn children with SCD, taking penicillin two times a day has been shown to reduce the chance of having a severe infection caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. Infants need to take liquid penicillin. Older children can take tablets.\n                \nMany doctors will stop prescribing penicillin after a child has reached the age of 5. Some prefer to continue this antibiotic throughout life, particularly if a person has hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia, since people with SCD are still at risk. All people who have had surgical removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, or a past infection with pneumococcus should keep taking penicillin throughout life.\n                \nImmunizations\n                \nPeople with SCD should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. They should also receive additional vaccines to prevent other infections.\n                \nPneumococcus. Even though all children routinely receive the vaccine against pneumococcus (PCV13), children with SCD should also receive a second kind of vaccine against pneumococcus (PPSV23). This second vaccine is given after 24 months of age and again 5 years later. Adults with SCD who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine should get a dose of the PCV13 vaccine. They should later receive the PPSV23 if they have not already received it or it has been more than 5 years since they did. A person should follow these guidelines even if he or she is still taking penicillin.\n                \nInfluenza. All people with SCD should receive an influenza shot every year at the start of flu season. This should begin at 6 months of age. Only the inactivated vaccine, which comes as a shot, should be used in people with SCD.\n                \nMeningococcus. A child with SCD should receive this vaccine (Menactra or Menveo) at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age. The child should receive a booster vaccine 3 years after this series of shots, then every 5 years after that.\n                \nScreening Tests and Evaluations\n                \nHeight, Weight, Blood Pressure, and Oxygen Saturation\n                \nDoctors will monitor height and weight to be sure that a child is growing properly and that a person with SCD is maintaining a healthy weight.\n                \nDoctors will also track a persons blood pressure. When a person with SCD has high blood pressure, it needs to be treated promptly because it can increase the risk of stroke.\n                \nOxygen saturation testing provides information about how much oxygen the blood is carrying.\n                \nBlood and Urine Testing\n                \nPeople with SCD need to have frequent lab tests.\n                \nBlood tests help to establish a persons baseline for problems like anemia. Blood testing also helps to show whether a person has organ damage, so that it can be treated early.\n                \nUrine testing can help to detect early kidney problems or infections.\n                \nTranscranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening\n                \nChildren who have hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia and are between the ages of 2 and 16 should have TCD testing once a year.\n                \nThis study can find out whether a child is at higher risk for stroke. When the test is abnormal, regular blood transfusions can decrease the chances of having a stroke.\n                \nThe child is awake during the TCD exam. The test does not hurt at all. The TCD machine uses sound waves to measure blood flow like the ultrasound machine used to examine pregnant women.\n                \nEye Examinations\n                \nAn eye doctor, or ophthalmologist, should examine a persons eyes every 12 years from the age of 10 onwards.\n                \nThese exams can detect if there are SCD-related problems of the eye. Regular exams can help doctors find and treat problems early to prevent loss of vision. A person should see his or her doctor right away for any sudden change in vision.\n                \nPulmonary Hypertension\n                \nDoctors have different approaches to screening for pulmonary hypertension. This is because studies have not given clear information as to when and how a person should receive the screening. People with SCD and their caretakers should discuss with their doctor whether screening makes sense for them.\n                \nCognitive Screening\n                \nPeople with sickle cell disease can develop cognitive (thinking) problems that may be hard to notice early in life.\n                \nSometimes these problems are caused by silent strokes that can only be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.\n                \nPeople with SCD should tell their doctors or nurses if they have thinking problems, such as difficulties learning in school, slowed decision making, or trouble organizing their thoughts.\n                \nPeople can be referred for cognitive testing. This testing can identify areas in which a person could use extra help.\n                \nChildren with SCD who have thinking problems may qualify for an Individualized Education Program, or IEP. An IEP is a plan that helps students to reach their educational goals. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational rehabilitation programs that can help them with job training.\n                \nEducation and Guidance\n                \nDoctors and other providers will talk with people who have SCD and their caretakers about complications and also review information at every visit.\n                \nBecause there are a lot of things to discuss, new topics are often introduced as a child or adult reaches an age when that subject is important to know about.\n                \nDoctors and nurses know that there is a lot of information to learn, and they dont expect people to know everything after one discussion. People with SCD and their families should not be afraid to ask questions.\n                \nTopics that are usually covered include:\n                \nHours that medical staff are available and contact information to use when people with SCD or caretakers have questions\n                \nA plan for what to do and where to get care if a person has a fever, pain, or other signs of SCD complications that need immediate attention\n                \nHow SCD is inherited and the risk of having a child with SCD\n                \nThe importance of regular medical visits, screening tests, and evaluations\n                \nHow to recognize and manage pain\n                \nHow to palpate (feel) a childs spleen. Because of the risk of splenic sequestration crisis, caretakers should learn how to palpate a childs spleen. They should try to feel for the spleen daily and more frequently when the child is ill. If they feel that the spleen is bigger than usual, they should call the care provider. \n                \nTransitioning Care\n                \nWhen children with SCD become adolescents or young adults, they often need to transition from a pediatric care team to an adult care team. This period has been shown to be associated with increased hospital admissions and medical problems. There seem to be many reasons for this.\n                \nSome of the increased risk is directly related to the disease. As people with SCD get older, they often develop more organ damage and more disabilities.\n                \nThe shift in care usually occurs at the same time that adolescents are undergoing many changes in their emotional, social, and academic lives. The transition to more independent self-management may be difficult, and following treatment plans may become less likely.\n                \nWhen compared with pediatrics, there are often fewer adult SCD programs available in a given region. This makes it more difficult for a person with SCD to find appropriate doctors, particularly those with whom they feel comfortable.\n                \nTo improve use of regular medical care by people with SCD and to reduce age-related complications, many SCD teams have developed special programs that the make transition easier. Such programs should involve the pediatric and the adult care teams. They should also start early and continue over several years.\n                \nManaging Some Complications of SCD\n                \nAcute Pain\n                \nEach person with SCD should have a home treatment regimen that is best suited to their needs. The providers on the SCD team usually help a person develop a written, tailored care plan. If possible, the person with SCD should carry this plan with them when they go to the emergency room.\n                \nWhen an acute crisis is just starting, most doctors will advise the person to drink lots of fluids and to take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medication, such as ibuprofen. When a person has kidney problems, acetaminophen is often preferred.\n                \nIf pain persists, many people will find that they need a stronger medicine.\n                \nCombining additional interventions, such as massage, relaxation methods, or a heating pad, may also help.\n                \nIf a person with SCD cannot control the pain at home, he or she should go to an SCD day hospital/outpatient unit or an emergency room to receive additional, stronger medicines and intravenous (IV) fluids.\n                \nSome people may be able to return home once their pain is under better control. In this case, the doctor may prescribe additional pain medicines for a short course of therapy.\n                \nPeople often need to be admitted to the hospital to fully control an acute pain crisis.\n                \nWhen taken daily, hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of pain episodes.\n                \nChronic Pain\n                \nSometimes chronic pain results from a complication, such as a leg ulcer or aseptic necrosis of the hip. In this case, doctors try to treat the complication causing the pain.\n                \nWhile chronic pain is common in adults with SCD, the cause is often poorly understood. Taking pain medicines daily may help to decrease the pain. Some examples of these medicines include:\n                \nNSAID drugs, such as ibuprofen\n                \nDuloxetine\n                \nGabapentin\n                \nAmitriptyline\n                \nStrong pain medicines, such as opiates\n                \nOther approaches, such as massage, heat, or acupuncture may be helpful in some cases. Chronic pain often comes with feelings of depression and anxiety. Supportive counseling and, sometimes, antidepressant medicines may help. (See coping and emotional issues.)\n                \nSevere Anemia\n                \nPeople should see their doctors or go to a hospital right away if they develop anemia symptoms from a splenic sequestration crisis or an aplastic crisis. These conditions can be life-threatening, and the person will need careful monitoring and treatment in the hospital. A person also usually needs a blood transfusion.\n                \nPeople with SCD and symptoms of severe anemia from other causes should also see a doctor right away.\n                \nInfections\n                \nFever is a medical emergency in SCD. All caretakers of infants and children with SCD should take their child to their doctor or go to a hospital right away when their child has a fever. Adults with SCD should also seek care for fever or other signs of infection.\n                \nAll children and adults who have SCD and a fever (over 38.50 C or 101.30 F) must be seen by a doctor and treated with antibiotics right away.\n                \nSome people will need to be hospitalized, while others may receive care and follow-up as an outpatient.\n                \nAcute Chest Syndrome\n                \nPeople with SCD and symptoms of acute chest syndrome should see their doctor or go to a hospital right away.\n                \nThey will need to be admitted to the hospital where they should receive antibiotics and close monitoring. They may need oxygen therapy and a blood transfusion.\n                \nWhen taken daily, the medicine hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of acute chest events.\n                \nClinical Stroke\n                \nPeople with SCD who have symptoms of stroke should be brought to the hospital right away by an ambulance. If a person is having symptoms of stroke, someone should call 9-1-1.\n                \nSymptoms of stroke may include:\n                \nWeakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body\n                \nTrouble speaking, walking, or understanding\n                \nLoss of balance\n                \nSevere headache\n                \nIf imaging studies reveal that the person has had an acute stroke, he or she may need an exchange transfusion. This procedure involves slowly removing an amount of the persons blood and replacing it with blood from a donor who does not have SCD or sickle cell trait. Afterward, the person may need to receive monthly transfusions or other treatments to help to prevent another stroke.\n                \nSilent Stroke and Cognitive Problems\n                \nChildren and adults with SCD and cognitive problems may be able to get useful help based upon the results of their testing. For instance, children may qualify for an IEP. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational, or job, training programs.\n                \nPriapism\n                \nSometimes, a person may be able to relieve priapism by:\n                \nEmptying the bladder by urinating\n                \nTaking medicine\n                \nIncreasing fluid intake\n                \nDoing light exercise\n                \nIf a person has an episode that lasts for 4 hours or more, he should go to the hospital to see a hematologist and urologist.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nPregnant women with SCD are at greater risk for problems. They should always see an obstetrician, or OB, who has experience with SCD and high-risk pregnancies and deliveries.\n                \nThe obstetrician should work with a hematologist or primary medical doctor who is well informed about SCD and its complications.\n                \nPregnant women with SCD need more frequent medical visits so that their doctors can follow them closely. The doctor may prescribe certain vitamins and will be careful to prescribe pain medicines that are safe for the baby.\n                \nA pregnant woman with SCD may need to have one or more blood transfusions during her pregnancy to treat complications, such as worsening anemia or an increased number of pain or acute chest syndrome events.\n                \nHydroxyurea\n                \nWhat Is Hydroxyurea?\n                \nHydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications.\n                \nThis medicine was studied in patients with SCD because it was known to increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in the blood. Increased hemoglobin F provides some protection against the effects of hemoglobin S.\n                \nHydroxyurea was later found to have several other benefits for a person with SCD, such as decreasing inflammation.\n                \nUse in adults. Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It also improved anemia and decreased the need for transfusions and hospital admissions.\n                \nUse in children. Studies in children with severe hemoglobin SS or S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. A study of very young children (between the ages of 9 and 18 months) with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea decreased the number of episodes of pain and dactylitis.\n                \nWho Should Use Hydroxyurea?\n                \nSince hydroxyurea can decrease several complications of SCD, most experts recommend that children and adults with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia who have frequent painful episodes, recurrent chest crises, or severe anemia take hydroxyurea daily.\n                \nSome experts offer hydroxyurea to all infants over 9 months of age and young children with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia, even if they do not have severe clinical problems, to prevent or reduce the chance of complications. There is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months of age.\n                \nSome experts will prescribe hydroxyurea to people with other types of SCD who have severe, recurrent pain. There is little information available about how effective hydroxyurea is for these types of SCD.\n                \nIn all situations, people with SCD should discuss with their doctors whether or not hydroxyurea is an appropriate medication for them.\n                \nPregnant women should not use hydroxyurea.\n                \nHow Is Hydroxyurea Taken?\n                \nTo work properly, hydroxyurea should be taken by mouth daily at the prescribed dose. When a person does not take it regularly, it will not work as well, or it wont work at all.\n                \nA person with SCD who is taking hydroxyurea needs careful monitoring. This is particularly true in the early weeks of taking the medicine. Monitoring includes regular blood testing and dose adjustments.\n                \nWhat Are the Risks of Hydroxyurea?\n                \nHydroxyurea can cause the bloods white cell count or platelet count to drop. In rare cases, it can worsen anemia. These side effects usually go away quickly if a person stops taking the medication. When a person restarts it, a doctor usually prescribes a lower dose.\n                \nOther short-term side effects are less common.\n                \nIt is still unclear whether hydroxyurea can cause problems later in life in people with SCD who take it for many years. Studies so far suggest that it does not put people at a higher risk of cancer and does not affect growth in children. But further studies are needed.\n                \nRed Blood Cell Transfusions\n                \nDoctors may use acute and chronic red blood cell transfusions to treat and prevent certain SCD complications. The red blood cells in a transfusion have normal hemoglobin in them.\n                \nA transfusion helps to raise the number of red blood cells and provides normal red blood cells that are more flexible than red blood cells with sickle hemoglobin. These cells live longer in the circulation. Red blood cell transfusions decrease vaso-occlusion (blockage in the blood vessel) and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs.\n                \nAcute Transfusion in SCD\n                \nDoctors use blood transfusions in SCD for complications that cause severe anemia. They may also use them when a person has an acute stroke, in many cases of acute chest crises, and in multi-organ failure.\n                \nA person with SCD usually receives blood transfusions before surgery to prevent SCD-related complications afterwards.\n                \nChronic Transfusion\n                \nDoctors recommend regular or ongoing blood transfusions for people who have had an acute stroke, since transfusions decrease the chances of having another stroke.\n                \nDoctors also recommend chronic blood transfusions for children who have abnormal TCD ultrasound results because transfusions can reduce the chance of having a first stroke.\n                \nSome doctors use this approach to treat complications that do not improve with hydroxyurea. They may also use transfusions in people who have too many side effects from hydroxyurea.\n                \nWhat Are the Risks of Transfusion Therapy?\n                \nPossible complications include:\n                \nHemolysis\n                \nIron overload, particularly in people receiving chronic transfusions (can severely impair heart and lung function)\n                \nInfection\n                \nAlloimmunization (can make it hard to find a matching unit of blood for a future transfusion)\n                \nAll blood banks and hospital personnel have adopted practices to reduce the risk of transfusion problems.\n                \nPeople with SCD who receive transfusions should be monitored for and immunized against hepatitis. They should also receive regular screenings for iron overload. If a person has iron overload, the doctor will give chelation therapy, a medicine to reduce the amount of iron in the body and the problems that iron overload causes.\n                \n\n                \nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n                \nAt the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. People with SCD and their families should ask their doctor about this procedure.\n                \nWhat Are Stem Cells?\n                \nStem cells are special cells that can divide over and over again. After they divide, these cells can go on to become blood red cells, white cells, or platelets.\n                \nA person with SCD has stem cells that make red blood cells that can sickle. People without SCD have stem cells that make red cells that usually wont sickle.\n                \nWhat Stem Cells Are Used in HSCT?\n                \nIn HSCT, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood of a person who does not have sickle cell disease (the donor). The donor, however, may have sickle cell trait.\n                \nThe donor is often the persons sister or brother. This is because the safest and most successful transplants use stem cells that are matched for special proteins called HLA antigens. Since these antigens are inherited from parents, a sister or brother is the most likely person to have the same antigens as the person with SCD.\n                \nWhat Happens During HSCT?\n                \nFirst, stem cells are taken from the donor. After this, the person with SCD (the recipient) is treated with drugs that destroy or reduce his or her own bone marrow stem cells.\n                \nThe donor stem cells are then injected into the persons vein. The injected cells will make a home in the recipients bone marrow, gradually replacing the recipients cells. The new stem cells will make red cells that do not sickle.\n                \nWhich People Receive HSCT?\n                \nAt the present time, most SCD transplants are performed in children who have had complications such as strokes, acute chest crises, and recurring pain crises. These transplants usually use a matched donor.\n                \nBecause only about 1 in 10 children with SCD has a matched donor without SCD in their families, the number of people with SCD who get transplants is low.\n                \nHSCT is more risky in adults, and that is why most transplants are done in children.\n                \nThere are several medical centers that are researching new SCD HSCT techniques in children and adults who dont have a matched donor in the family or are older than most recipients. Hopefully, more people with SCD will be able to receive a transplant in the future, using these new methods.\n                \nWhat Are the Risks?\n                \nHSCT is successful in about 85 percent of children when the donor is related and HLA matched. Even with this high success rate, HSCT still has risks.\n                \nComplications can include severe infections, seizures, and other clinical problems. About 5 percent of people have died. Sometimes transplanted cells attack the recipients organs (graft versus host disease).\n                \nMedicines are given to prevent many of the complications, but they still can happen."

            "question": "What is (are) Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ?",
            "answer": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder. In TTP, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body.\n                \nThe clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop.\n                \nThe increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. These cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nWith fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.\n                \n\"Thrombotic\" (throm-BOT-ik) refers to the blood clots that form. \"Thrombocytopenic\" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. \"Purpura\" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin.\n                \nBleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\n                \nPurpura and Petechiae\n                \n\n                \nTTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh)a rare form of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes TTP. The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting. The enzyme breaks up a large protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots.\n                \nTypes of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n                \nThe two main types of TTP are inherited and acquired. \"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. This type of TTP mainly affects newborns and children.\n                \nIn inherited TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty and doesn't prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.\n                \nAcquired TTP is the more common type of the disorder. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it. This type of TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children.\n                \nIn acquired TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene isn't faulty. Instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nIt's not clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:\n                \nSome diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections\n                \nSome medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nSome medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens\n                \nQuinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products\n                \nIf you have TTP, you may sometimes hear it referred to as TTPHUS. HUS, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is a disorder that resembles TTP, but is more common in children. Kidney problems also tend to be worse in HUS. Although some researchers think TTP and HUS are two forms of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that each has different causes.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nTTP is a rare disorder. It can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it's not treated right away.\n                \nTTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can continue for months. Relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of TTP. Many people who have inherited TTP have frequent flareups that need to be treated.\n                \nTreatments for TTP include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis (PLAZ-ma-feh-RE-sis). These treatments have greatly improved the outlook of the disorder."

            "answer": "A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting.\n                \nNot having enough enzyme activity causes overactive blood clotting. In TTP, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop.\n                \nThe increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up many of the blood's platelets. With fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur.\n                \nPeople who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.\n                \nTTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia.\n                \nInherited Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n                \nIn inherited TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty. It doesn't prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.\n                \n\"Inherited\" means that the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. A person who inherits TTP is born with two copies of the faulty geneone from each parent.\n                \nMost often, the parents each have one copy of the faulty gene, but have no signs or symptoms TTP.\n                \nAcquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n                \nIn acquired TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene isn't faulty. Instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \n\"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it sometime after birth.\n                \nTriggers for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n                \nIt's unclear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:\n                \nSome diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections\n                \nSome medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nSome medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens\n                \nQuinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products"

            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nIf TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you:\n                \nHave certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant).\n                \nHave had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant.\n                \nTake certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy.\n                \nHave used any products that contain quinine.

For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nIf you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia).\n                \nBlood Smear\n                \nFor this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken.\n                \nPlatelet Count\n                \nThis test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP.\n                \nBilirubin Test\n                \nWhen red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice.\n                \nFor this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal.\n                \nKidney Function Tests and Urine Tests\n                \nThese tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys.\n                \nCoombs Test\n                \nThis blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nIn TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots.\n                \nWhen TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells.\n                \nLactate Dehydrogenase Test\n                \nThis blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nHemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP.\n                \nADAMTS13 Assay\n                \nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme's activity."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ?",
            "answer": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it's not treated right away.\n                \nIn most cases, TTP occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can go on for months. Relapses (flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have acquired TTP. Flareups also occur in most people who have inherited TTP.\n                \nPlasma treatments are the most common way to treat TTP. Other treatments include medicines and surgery. Treatments are done in a hospital.\n                \nPlasma Therapy\n                \nPlasma is the liquid part of your blood. It carries blood cells, hormones, enzymes, and nutrients to your body.\n                \nTTP is treated with plasma therapy. This includes:\n                \nFresh frozen plasma for people who have inherited TTP\n                \nPlasma exchange for people who have acquired TTP\n                \nPlasma therapy is started in the hospital as soon as TTP is diagnosed or suspected.\n                \nFor inherited TTP, fresh frozen plasma is given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. This is done to replace the missing or changed ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nPlasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis) is used to treat acquired TTP. This is a lifesaving procedure. It removes antibodies (proteins) from the blood that damage your ADAMTS13 enzyme. Plasma exchange also replaces the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nIf plasma exchange isn't available, you may be given fresh frozen plasma until it is available.\n                \nDuring plasma exchange, an IV needle or tube is placed in a vein in your arm to remove blood. The blood goes through a cell separator, which removes plasma from the blood. The nonplasma part of the blood is saved, and donated plasma is added to it.\n                \nThen, the blood is put back into you through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels. The time required to complete the procedure varies, but it often takes about 2hours.\n                \nTreatments of fresh frozen plasma or plasma exchange usually continue until your blood tests results and signs and symptoms improve. This can take days or weeks, depending on your condition. You'll stay in the hospital while you recover.\n                \nSome people who recover from TTP have flareups. This can happen in the hospital or after you go home. If you have a flareup, your doctor will restart plasma therapy.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments are used if plasma therapy doesn't work well or if flareups occur often.\n                \nFor acquired TTP, medicines can slow or stop antibodies to the ADAMTS13 enzyme from forming. Medicines used to treat TTP include glucocorticoids, vincristine, rituximab, and cyclosporine A.\n                \nSometimes surgery to remove the spleen (an organ in the abdomen) is needed. This is because cells in the spleen make the antibodies that block ADAMTS13 enzyme activity."

            "question": "What is (are) Stroke ?",
            "answer": "A stroke occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. Without oxygen, brain cells start to die after a few minutes. Sudden bleeding in the brain also can cause a stroke if it damages brain cells.\n                \nIf brain cells die or are damaged because of a stroke, symptoms occur in the parts of the body that these brain cells control. Examples of stroke symptoms include sudden weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs (paralysis is an inability to move); trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing.\n                \nA stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.\n                \nIf you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-KE-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-RAJ-ik). Ischemic is the more common type of stroke.\n                \nAn ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes.\n                \nA hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The pressure from the leaked blood damages brain cells. High blood pressure and aneurysms (AN-u-risms) are examples of conditions that can cause hemorrhagic strokes. (Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst.)\n                \nAnother condition thats similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack, also called a TIA or mini-stroke. A TIA occurs if blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked only for a short time. Thus, damage to the brain cells isnt permanent (lasting).\n                \nLike ischemic strokes, TIAs often are caused by blood clots. Although TIAs are not full-blown strokes, they greatly increase the risk of having a stroke. If you have a TIA, its important for your doctor to find the cause so you can take steps to prevent a stroke.\n                \nBoth strokes and TIAs require emergency care.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nStroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Many factors can raise your risk of having a stroke. Talk with your doctor about how you can control these risk factors and help prevent a stroke.\n                \nIf you have a stroke, prompt treatment can reduce damage to your brain and help you avoid lasting disabilities. Prompt treatment also may help prevent another stroke.\n                \nResearchers continue to study the causes and risk factors for stroke. Theyre also finding new and better treatments and new ways to help the brain repair itself after a stroke."

            "question": "What causes Stroke ?",
            "answer": "Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack\n                \nAn ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Many medical conditions can increase the risk of ischemic stroke or TIA.\n                \nFor example, atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis) is a disease in which a fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner walls of the arteries. Plaque hardens and narrows the arteries, which limits the flow of blood to tissues and organs (such as the heart and brain).\n                \nPlaque in an artery can crack or rupture (break open). Blood platelets (PLATE-lets), which are disc-shaped cell fragments, stick to the site of the plaque injury and clump together to form blood clots. These clots can partly or fully block an artery.\n                \nPlaque can build up in any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, and neck. The two main arteries on each side of the neck are called the carotid (ka-ROT-id) arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain, face, scalp, and neck.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, the condition is called carotid artery disease. Carotid artery disease causes many of the ischemic strokes and TIAs that occur in the United States.\n                \nAn embolic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke) or TIA also can occur if a blood clot or piece of plaque breaks away from the wall of an artery. The clot or plaque can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brains arteries. This stops blood flow through the artery and damages brain cells.\n                \nHeart conditions and blood disorders also can cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke or TIA. For example, atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), or AF, is a common cause of embolic stroke.\n                \nIn AF, the upper chambers of the heart contract in a very fast and irregular way. As a result, some blood pools in the heart. The pooling increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers.\n                \nAn ischemic stroke or TIA also can occur because of lesions caused by atherosclerosis. These lesions may form in the small arteries of the brain, and they can block blood flow to the brain.\n                \nHemorrhagic Stroke\n                \nSudden bleeding in the brain can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding causes swelling of the brain and increased pressure in the skull. The swelling and pressure damage brain cells and tissues.\n                \nExamples of conditions that can cause a hemorrhagic stroke include high blood pressure, aneurysms, and arteriovenous (ar-TEER-e-o-VE-nus) malformations (AVMs).\n                \n\"Blood pressure\" is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If blood pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\n                \nAneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. AVMs are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. High blood pressure can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in people who have aneurysms or AVMs."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Stroke? ?",
            "answer": "Certain traits, conditions, and habits can raise your risk of having a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). These traits, conditions, and habits are known as risk factors.\n                \nThe more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to have a stroke. You can treat or control some risk factors, such as high blood pressure and smoking. Other risk factors, such as age and gender, you cant control.\n                \nThe major risk factors for stroke include:\n                \nHigh blood pressure. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.\n                \nDiabetes. Diabetes is a disease in which the blood sugar level is high because the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy.\n                \nHeart diseases.Coronary heart disease,cardiomyopathy,heart failure, andatrial fibrillationcan cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke.\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Smoking also may reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches your bodys tissues. Exposure to secondhand smoke also can damage the blood vessels.\n                \nAge and gender. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. At younger ages, men are more likely than women to have strokes. However, women are more likely to die from strokes. Women who take birth control pills also are at slightly higher risk of stroke.\n                \nRace and ethnicity. Strokes occur more often in African American, Alaska Native, and American Indian adults than in white, Hispanic, or Asian American adults.\n                \nPersonal or family history of stroke or TIA. If youve had a stroke, youre at higher risk for another one. Your risk of having a repeat stroke is the highest right after a stroke. A TIA also increases your risk of having a stroke, as does having a family history of stroke.\n                \nBrainaneurysmsor arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. AVMs are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture (break open) within the brain. AVMs may be present at birth, but often arent diagnosed until they rupture.\n                \nOther risk factors for stroke, many of which of you can control, include:\n                \nAlcohol and illegal drug use, including cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs\n                \nCertain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), and bleeding disorders\n                \nLack of physical activity\n                \nOverweight and Obesity\n                \nStress and depression\n                \nUnhealthy cholesterol levels\n                \nUnhealthy diet\n                \nUse of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not aspirin, may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly in patients who have had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery. The risk may increase the longer NSAIDs are used. Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen.\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of stroke. Some people also may need to take medicines to lower their risk. Sometimes strokes can occur in people who dont have any known risk factors."

How long symptoms last and how severe they are vary among different people.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of a stroke may include:\n                \nSudden weakness\n                \nParalysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body\n                \nConfusion\n                \nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\n                \nTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\n                \nProblems breathing\n                \nDizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls\n                \nLoss of consciousness\n                \nSudden and severe headache\n                \nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) has the same signs and symptoms as a stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last less than 12 hours (although they may last up to 24 hours). A TIA may occur only once in a persons lifetime or more often.\n                \nAt first, it may not be possible to tell whether someone is having a TIA or stroke. All stroke-like symptoms require medical care.\n                \nIf you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.\n                \nStroke Complications\n                \nAfter youve had a stroke, you may develop other complications, such as:\n                \nBlood clots and muscle weakness. Being immobile (unable to move around) for a long time can raise your risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Being immobile also can lead to muscle weakness and decreased muscle flexibility.\n                \nProblems swallowing and pneumonia. If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You also may be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia.\n                \nLoss of bladder control. Some strokes affect the muscles used to urinate. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Loss of bowel control or constipation also may occur after a stroke."

            "question": "How to diagnose Stroke ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose a stroke based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nYour doctor will want to find out the type of stroke youve had, its cause, the part of the brain that's affected, and whether you have bleeding in the brain.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks youve had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), he or she will look for its cause to help prevent a future stroke.\n                \nMedical History and Physical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will ask you or a family member about your risk factors for stroke. Examples of risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and a personal or family history of stroke. Your doctor also will ask about your signs and symptoms and when they began.\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will check your mental alertness and your coordination and balance. He or she will check for numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs; confusion; and trouble speaking and seeing clearly.\n                \nYour doctor will look for signs of carotid artery disease, a common cause of ischemic stroke. He or she will listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E) may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup in the carotid arteries.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose a stroke or TIA.\n                \nBrain Computed Tomography\n                \nA brain computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or brain CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your brain. This test often is done right after a stroke is suspected.\n                \nA brain CT scan can show bleeding in the brain or damage to the brain cells from a stroke. The test also can show other brain conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test can detect changes in brain tissue and damage to brain cells from a stroke.\n                \nAn MRI may be used instead of, or in addition to, a CT scan to diagnose a stroke.\n                \nComputed Tomography Arteriogram and Magnetic Resonance Arteriogram\n                \nA CT arteriogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance arteriogram (MRA) can show the large blood vessels in the brain. These tests may give your doctor more information about the site of a blood clot and the flow of blood through your brain.\n                \nCarotid Ultrasound\n                \nCarotid ultrasound is a painless and harmless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain.\n                \nCarotid ultrasound shows whether plaque has narrowed or blocked your carotid arteries.\n                \nYour carotid ultrasound test may include a Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound is a special test that shows the speed and direction of blood moving through your blood vessels.\n                \nCarotid Angiography\n                \nCarotid angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your carotid arteries.\n                \nFor this test, a small tube called a catheter is put into an artery, usually in the groin (upper thigh). The tube is then moved up into one of your carotid arteries.\n                \nYour doctor will inject a substance (called contrast dye) into the carotid artery. The dye helps make the artery visible on x-ray pictures.\n                \nHeart Tests\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can help detect heart problems that may have led to a stroke. For example, the test can help diagnose atrial fibrillation or a previous heart attack.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart.\n                \nThe test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho can detect possible blood clots inside the heart and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to all parts of your body.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nYour doctor also may use blood tests to help diagnose a stroke.\n                \nA blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke.\n                \nA platelet count measures the number of platelets in your blood. Blood platelets are cell fragments that help your blood clot. Abnormal platelet levels may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting).\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests to measure how long it takes for your blood to clot. Two tests that may be used are called PT and PTT tests. These tests show whether your blood is clotting normally."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Stroke ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for a stroke depends on whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) depends on its cause, how much time has passed since symptoms began, and whether you have other medical conditions.\n                \nStrokes and TIAs are medical emergencies. If you have stroke symptoms, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.\n                \nOnce you receive immediate treatment, your doctor will try to treat your stroke risk factors and prevent complications by recommending heart-healthy lifestyle changes.\n                \nTreating an Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack\n                \nAn ischemic stroke or TIA occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Often, blood clots cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes and TIAs. Treatment for an ischemic stroke or TIA may include medicines and medical procedures.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A doctor will inject tPA into a vein in your arm. This type of medication must be given within 4hours of symptom onset. Ideally, it should be given as soon as possible. The sooner treatment begins, the better your chances of recovery. Thus, its important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke and to call 911 right away for emergency care.\n                \nIf you cant have tPA for medical reasons, your doctor may give you antiplatelet medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner) that keeps existing blood clots from getting larger. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nIf you have carotid artery disease, your doctor may recommend a carotid endarterectomy or carotid arteryangioplasty. Both procedures open blocked carotid arteries.\n                \nResearchers are testing other treatments for ischemic stroke, such as intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI).\n                \nIn intra-arterial thrombolysis, a long flexible tube called a catheter is put into your groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the tiny arteries of the brain. Your doctor can deliver medicine through this catheter to break up a blood clot in the brain.\n                \nMERCI is a device that can remove blood clots from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is threaded through a carotid artery to the affected artery in the brain. The device is then used to pull the blood clot out through the catheter.\n                \nTreating a Hemorrhagic Stroke\n                \nA hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The first steps in treating a hemorrhagic stroke are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Unlike ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes arent treated with antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners because these medicines can make bleeding worse.\n                \nIf youre taking antiplatelet medicines or blood thinners and have a hemorrhagic stroke, youll be taken off the medicine. If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding in the brain, your doctor may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure. This can help prevent further bleeding.\n                \nSurgery also may be needed to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. The types of surgery used include aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair.\n                \nAneurysm Clipping and Coil Embolization\n                \nIf an aneurysm (a balloon-like bulge in an artery) is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend aneurysm clipping or coil embolization.\n                \nAneurysm clipping is done to block off the aneurysm from the blood vessels in the brain. This surgery helps prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.During the procedure, a surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the brain and place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. After the surgery, youll need to stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for a few days.\n                \nCoil embolization is a less complex procedure for treating an aneurysm. The surgeon will insert a tube called a catheter into an artery in the groin. He or she will thread the tube to the site of the aneurysm.Then, a tiny coil will be pushed through the tube and into the aneurysm. The coil will cause a blood clot to form, which will block blood flow through the aneurysm and prevent it from burstingagain.Coil embolization is done in a hospital. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during thesurgery.\n                \nArteriovenous Malformation Repair\n                \nIf an AVM is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend an AVM repair. (An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.) AVM repair helps prevent further bleeding in the brain.\n                \nDoctors use several methods to repair AVMs. These methods include:\n                \nInjecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow\n                \nSurgery to remove the AVM\n                \nUsing radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM\n                \nTreating Stroke Risk Factors\n                \nAfter initial treatment for a stroke or TIA, your doctor will treat your risk factors. He or she may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help control your risk factors.\n                \nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes may include:\n                \nheart-healthy eating\n                \nmaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nmanaging stress\n                \nphysical activity\n                \nquitting smoking\n                \nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nTry to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for stroke. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many risk factors for stroke.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for stroke. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart."

            "question": "What is (are) Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?",
            "answer": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (ko-ag-u-LA-shun), or DIC, is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body's organs.\n                \nIn DIC, the increased clotting uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) and clotting factors in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins needed for normal blood clotting.\n                \nWith fewer platelets and clotting factors in the blood, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding.\n                \nInternal bleeding occurs inside the body. External bleeding occurs underneath or from the skin or mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.)\n                \nDIC can cause life-threatening bleeding.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand DIC, it helps to understand the body's normal blood clotting process. Your body has a system to control bleeding. When small cuts or breaks occur on blood vessel walls, your body activates clotting factors. These clotting factors, such as thrombin and fibrin, work with platelets to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots seal the small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. After bleeding stops and the vessels heal, your body breaks down and removes the clots.\n                \nSome diseases and conditions can cause clotting factors to become overactive, leading to DIC. These diseases and conditions include:\n                \nSepsis (an infection in the bloodstream)\n                \nSurgery and trauma\n                \nCancer\n                \nSerious complications of pregnancy and childbirth\n                \nExamples of less common causes of DIC are bites from poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), frostbite, and burns.\n                \nThe two types of DIC are acute and chronic. Acute DIC develops quickly (over hours or days) and must be treated right away. The condition begins with excessive blood clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding.\n                \nChronic DIC develops slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC. Chronic DIC causes excessive blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. Cancer is the most common cause of chronic DIC.\n                \nTreatment for DIC involves treating the clotting and bleeding problems and the underlying cause of the condition.\n                \nPeople who have acute DIC may need blood transfusions, medicines, and other life-saving measures. People who have chronic DIC may need medicines to help prevent blood clots from forming in their small blood vessels.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe outlook for DIC depends on its severity and underlying cause. Acute DIC can damage the body's organs and even cause death if it's not treated right away. Chronic DIC also can damage the body's organs.\n                \nResearchers are looking for ways to prevent DIC or diagnose it early. They're also studying the use of various clotting proteins and medicines to treat the condition."

Chronic DIC develops more slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC.\n                \nWith acute DIC, blood clotting in the blood vessels usually occurs first, followed by bleeding. However, bleeding may be the first obvious sign. Serious bleeding can occur very quickly after developing acute DIC. Thus, emergency treatment in a hospital is needed.\n                \nBlood clotting also occurs with chronic DIC, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. Sometimes chronic DIC has no signs or symptoms.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Excessive Blood Clotting\n                \nIn DIC, blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This can cause the following signs and symptoms:\n                \nChest pain and shortness of breath if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your lungs and heart.\n                \nPain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg if blood clots form in the deep veins of your leg.\n                \nHeadaches, speech changes, paralysis (an inability to move), dizziness, and trouble speaking and understanding if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your brain. These signs and symptoms may indicate a stroke.\n                \nHeart attack and lung and kidney problems if blood clots lodge in your heart, lungs, or kidneys. These organs may even begin to fail.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Bleeding\n                \nIn DIC, the increased clotting activity uses up the platelets and clotting factors in the blood. As a result, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding.\n                \nInternal Bleeding\n                \nInternal bleeding can occur in your body's organs, such as the kidneys, intestines, and brain. This bleeding can be life threatening. Signs and symptoms of internal bleeding include:\n                \nBlood in your urine from bleeding in your kidneys or bladder.\n                \nBlood in your stools from bleeding in your intestines or stomach. Blood in your stools can appear red or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.)\n                \nHeadaches, double vision, seizures, and other symptoms from bleeding in your brain.\n                \nExternal Bleeding\n                \nExternal bleeding can occur underneath or from the skin, such as at the site of cuts or an intravenous (IV) needle. External bleeding also can occur from the mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.)\n                \nExternal bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin.\n                \nPurpura and Petechiae\n                \n\n                \nOther signs of external bleeding include:\n                \nProlonged bleeding, even from minor cuts.\n                \nBleeding or oozing from your gums or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth.\n                \nHeavy or extended menstrual bleeding in women."

If you have signs or symptoms of severe bleeding or blood clots, call 911 right away.\n                \nMedical History and Physical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will ask whether you have or have had any diseases or conditions that can trigger DIC. For more information about these diseases and conditions, go to \"What Causes Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation?\"\n                \nYour doctor will ask about signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and internal and external bleeding. For example, your doctor may look for bleeding from your gums.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nTo diagnose DIC, your doctor may recommend blood tests to look at your blood cells and the clotting process. For these tests, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\n                \nComplete Blood Count and Blood Smear\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood.\n                \nPlatelets are blood cell fragments that help with blood clotting. Abnormal platelet numbers may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting).\n                \nA blood smear is a test that may reveal whether your red blood cells are damaged.\n                \nTests for Clotting Factors and Clotting Time\n                \nThe following tests examine the proteins active in the blood clotting process and how long it takes them to form a blood clot.\n                \nPT and PTT tests.

Treatment may include blood transfusions, medicines, and oxygen therapy. (Oxygen is given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube.)\n                \nA blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure. You receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Blood transfusions are done to replace blood loss due to an injury, surgery, or illness.\n                \nBlood is made up of various parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Some blood transfusions involve whole blood (blood with all of its parts). More often though, only some parts of blood are transfused.\n                \nIf you have DIC, you may be given platelets and clotting factors, red blood cells, and plasma (the liquid part of blood).\n                \nChronic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\n                \nPeople who have chronic DIC are more likely to have blood clotting problems than bleeding. If you have chronic DIC, your doctor may treat you with medicines called anticoagulants, or blood thinners.\n                \nBlood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming.

            "question": "What is (are) Heart Block ?",
            "answer": "Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (\"Rate\" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. \"Rhythm\" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.)\n                \nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\n                \nHeart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nSome people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. If you're born with the condition, it's called congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart block. If the condition develops after birth, it's called acquired heart block.\n                \nDoctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. Certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. Some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\n                \nAcquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. Damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. Diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage.\n                \nThe three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. First degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. This is true for both congenital and acquired heart block.\n                \nDoctors use a test called an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. First-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms.\n                \nSecond-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. This type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint.\n                \nThird-degree heart block limits the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. Third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal.\n                \nA medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block.\n                \nAll types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fih-brih-LA-shun).

Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).\n                \nCongenital Heart Block\n                \nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\n                \nIn pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\n                \nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\n                \nAcquired Heart Block\n                \nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\n                \nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block.\n                \nCoronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease.\n                \nMyocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis), or inflammation of the heart muscle.\n                \nHeart failure.\n                \nRheumatic (roo-MAT-ik) fever.\n                \nCardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-a-the), or heart muscle diseases.\n                \nOther diseases may increase the risk of heart block. Examples include sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DOE-sis) and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\n                \nCertain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block.\n                \nExposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicinesincluding digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockersalso may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems.\n                \nSome types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes).\n                \nAn overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\n                \nIn some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\n                \nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."

He or she will listen carefully for abnormal rhythms or heart murmurs (extra or unusual sounds heard during heartbeats).\n                \nYour doctor also may:\n                \nCheck your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating\n                \nCheck for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure\n                \nLook for signs of other diseases that could be causing heart rate or rhythm problems (such as coronary heart disease)\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nDoctors usually use an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). The test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nThe data are recorded on a graph. Different types of heart block have different patterns on the graph. (For more information, go to \"Types of Heart Block.\")\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heart's activity for a few seconds. To diagnose heart rhythm problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor.\n                \nThe most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Your doctor may have you use one of these monitors to diagnose first- or second-degree heart block.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nA Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nYou may wear an event monitor for 1 to 2 months, or as long as it takes to get a recording of your heart during symptoms.\n                \nElectrophysiology Study\n                \nFor some cases of heart block, doctors may do electrophysiology studies (EPS). During this test, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nTo diagnose heart block, your doctor may recommend tests to rule out other types of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

            "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Block ?",
            "answer": "Treatment depends on the type of heart block you have. If you have first-degree heart block, you may not need treatment.\n                \nIf you have second-degree heart block, you may need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n                \nIf you have third-degree heart block, you will need a pacemaker. In an emergency, a temporary pacemaker might be used until you can get a long-term device. Most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives.\n                \nSome people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need pacemakers for many years. Others may need pacemakers at a young age or during infancy.\n                \nIf a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. If heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother might be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block.\n                \nSometimes acquired heart block goes away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\n                \nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the condition may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered.

            "question": "What is (are) Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Antiphospholipid (AN-te-fos-fo-LIP-id) antibody syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur if the body's immune system makes antibodies that attack and damage tissues or cells.\n                \nAntibodies are a type of protein. They usually help defend the body against infections. In APS, however, the body makes antibodies that mistakenly attack phospholipidsa type of fat.\n                \nPhospholipids are found in all living cells and cell membranes, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels.\n                \nWhen antibodies attack phospholipids, cells are damaged. This damage causes blood clots to form in the body's arteries and veins. (These are the vessels that carry blood to your heart and body.)\n                \nUsually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process. Blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls. This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.\n                \nOverview\n                \nSome people have APS antibodies, but don't ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn't mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.\n                \nAPS can lead to many health problems, such as stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), and pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm).\n                \nAPS also can cause pregnancy-related problems, such as multiple miscarriages, a miscarriage late in pregnancy, or a premature birth due to eclampsia (ek-LAMP-se-ah). (Eclampsia, which follows preeclampsia, is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.)\n                \nVery rarely, some people who have APS develop many blood clots within weeks or months. This condition is called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).\n                \nPeople who have APS also are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah). This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets). Antibodies destroy the platelets, or theyre used up during the clotting process. Mild to serious bleeding can occur with thrombocytopenia.\n                \nAPS can be fatal. Death may occur as a result of large blood clots or blood clots in the heart, lungs, or brain.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAPS can affect people of any age. However, it's more common in women and people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) disorders, such as lupus. (\"Rheumatic\" refers to disorders that affect the joints, bones, or muscles.)\n                \nAPS has no cure, but medicines can help prevent its complications. Medicines are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also are used to keep existing clots from getting larger. Treatment for APS is long term.\n                \nIf you have APS and another autoimmune disorder, it's important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems."

This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders.\n                \nYou may have APS and another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. If so, a doctor who specializes in that disorder also may provide treatment.\n                \nMany autoimmune disorders that occur with APS also affect the joints, bones, or muscles. Rheumatologists specialize in treating these types of disorders.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nSome people have APS antibodies but no signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn't mean that you have APS.

These tests check your blood for any of the three APS antibodies: anticardiolipin, beta-2 glycoprotein I (2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant.\n                \nThe term \"anticoagulant\" (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lant) refers to a substance that prevents blood clotting. It may seem odd that one of the APS antibodies is called lupus anticoagulant. The reason for this is because the antibody slows clotting in lab tests. However, in the human body, it increases the risk of blood clotting.\n                \nTo test for APS antibodies, a small blood sample is taken. It's often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, but it may cause some short-term discomfort and a slight bruise.\n                \nYou may need a second blood test to confirm positive results. This is because a single positive test can result from a short-term infection. The second blood test often is done 12 weeks or more after the first one."

If so, it's important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for new ways to treat APS.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nAnticoagulants, or \"blood thinners,\" are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also may keep existing blood clots from getting larger. These medicines are taken as either a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).\n                \nWarfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat APS. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.\n                \nYour doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.\n                \nAspirin also thins the blood and helps prevent blood clots. Sometimes aspirin is used with warfarin. Other times, aspirin might be used alone.\n                \nBlood thinners don't prevent APS. They simply reduce the risk of further blood clotting. Treatment with these medicines is long term. Discuss all treatment options with your doctor.\n                \nSide Effects\n                \nThe most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This happens if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.\n                \nSometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually need regular blood tests, called PT and PTT tests, to check how well their blood is clotting.\n                \nThese tests also show whether you're taking the right amount of medicine. Your doctor will check to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about the warning signs of internal bleeding and when to seek emergency care. (For more information, go to \"Living With Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.\")\n                \nTreatment During Pregnancy\n                \nPregnant women who have APS can have successful pregnancies. With proper treatment, these women are more likely to carry their babies to term.\n                \nPregnant women who have APS usually are treated with heparin or heparin and low-dose aspirin. Warfarin is not used as a treatment during pregnancy because it can harm the fetus.\n                \nBabies whose mothers have APS are at higher risk for slowed growth while in the womb. If you're pregnant and have APS, you may need to have extra ultrasound tests (sonograms) to check your babys growth. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to look at the growing fetus.\n                \nTreatment for Other Medical Conditions\n                \nPeople who have APS are at increased risk for thrombocytopenia. This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets. Platelets help the blood clot.\n                \nIf you have APS, you'll need regular complete blood counts (a type of blood test) to count the number of platelets in your blood.\n                \nThrombocytopenia is treated with medicines and medical procedures. For more information, go to the Health Topics Thrombocytopenia article.\n                \nIf you have other health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes, work with your doctor to manage them."

(\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes.) In some cases, a genetic mutation may cause the condition.\n                \nIn addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets, the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia. They may form blood clots or, surprisingly, cause bleeding when they don't work well.\n                \nBleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von Willebrand disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process.\n                \nAfter many years, scarring of the bone marrow can occur.\n                \nSecondary Thrombocytosis\n                \nThis condition occurs if another disease, condition, or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise. For example, 35 percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, and lymphoma. Sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer.\n                \nOther conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are:\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\n                \nHemolytic (HEE-moh-lit-ick) anemia\n                \nAbsence of a spleen (after surgery to remove the organ)\n                \nInflammatory or infectious diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis\n                \nReactions to medicine\n                \nSome conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time.

They include weakness, bleeding, headache, dizziness, chest pain, and tingling in the hands and feet.\n                \nBlood Clots\n                \nIn primary thrombocythemia, blood clots most often develop in the brain, hands, and feet. But they can develop anywhere in the body, including in the heart and intestines.\n                \nBlood clots in the brain may cause symptoms such as chronic (ongoing) headache and dizziness.

Signs of bleeding include nosebleeds, bruising, bleeding from the mouth or gums, or blood in the stools.\n                \nAlthough bleeding usually is associated with a low platelet count, it also can occur in people who have high platelet counts. Blood clots that develop in thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may use up your body's platelets. This means that not enough platelets are left in your bloodstream to seal off cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls.\n                \nAnother cause of bleeding in people who have very high platelets counts is a condition called von Willebrand Disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process.\n                \nIn rare cases of primary thrombocythemia, the faulty bone marrow cells will cause a form of leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells."

            "question": "How to diagnose Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in blood diseases and conditions.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask you about factors that can affect your platelets, such as:\n                \nAny medical procedures or blood transfusions you've had\n                \nAny recent infections or vaccines you've had\n                \nThe medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines\n                \nYour general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink\n                \nAny family history of high platelet counts\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will check for signs of conditions that can cause secondary thrombocytosis, such as an infection.\n                \nPrimary thrombocythemia is diagnosed only after all possible causes of a high platelet count are ruled out. For example, your doctor may recommend tests to check for early, undiagnosed cancer. If another disease, condition, or factor is causing a high platelet count, the diagnosis is secondary thrombocytosis.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a high platelet count.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\n                \nIf you have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis, the CBC results will show that your platelet count is high.\n                \nBlood Smear\n                \nA blood smear is used to check the condition of your platelets. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in the bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nBone marrow aspiration might be done to find out whether your bone marrow is making too many platelets. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\n                \nA bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow.\n                \nWith thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis, the bone marrow has a higher than normal number of the very large cells that make platelets.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other blood tests to look for genetic factors that can cause a high platelet count."

            "answer": "Primary Thrombocythemia\n                \nThis condition is considered less harmful today than in the past, and its outlook often is good. People who have no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable.\n                \nTaking aspirin may help people who are at risk for blood clots (aspirin thins the blood). However, talk with your doctor about using aspirin because it can cause bleeding.\n                \nDoctors prescribe aspirin to most pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia. This is because it doesn't have a high risk of side effects for the fetus.\n                \nSome people who have primary thrombocythemia may need medicines or medical procedures to lower their platelet counts.\n                \nMedicines To Lower Platelet Counts\n                \nYou may need medicines to lower your platelet count if you:\n                \nHave a history of blood clots or bleeding\n                \nHave risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes\n                \nAre older than 60\n                \nHave a platelet count over 1 million\n                \nYou'll need to take these medicines throughout your life.\n                \nHydroxyurea. This platelet-lowering medicine is used to treat cancers and other life-threatening diseases. Hydroxyurea most often is given under the care of doctors who specialize in cancer or blood diseases. Patients on hydroxyurea are closely monitored.\n                \nCurrently, hydroxyurea plus aspirin is the standard treatment for people who have primary thrombocythemia and are at high risk for blood clots.\n                \nAnagrelide. This medicine also has been used to lower platelet counts in people who have thrombocythemia. However, research shows that when compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide has worse outcomes. Anagrelide also has side effects, such as fluid retention, palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns), arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart failure, and headaches.\n                \nInterferon alfa. This medicine lowers platelet counts, but 20 percent of patients can't handle its side effects. Side effects include a flu-like feeling, decreased appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), diarrhea, seizures, irritability, and sleepiness.\n                \nDoctors may prescribe this medicine to pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia because it's safer for a fetus than hydroxyurea and anagrelide.\n                \nPlateletpheresis\n                \nPlateletpheresis (PLATE-let-fe-REH-sis) is a procedure used to rapidly lower your platelet count. This procedure is used only for emergencies. For example, if you're having a stroke due to primary thrombocythemia, you may need plateletpheresis.\n                \nAn intravenous (IV) needle that's connected to a tube is placed in one of your blood vessels to remove blood. The blood goes through a machine that removes platelets from the blood. The remaining blood is then put back into you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels.\n                \nOne or two procedures might be enough to reduce your platelet count to a safe level.\n                \nSecondary Thrombocytosis\n                \nSecondary thrombocytosis is treated by addressing the condition that's causing it.\n                \nPeople who have secondary thrombocytosis usually don't need platelet-lowering medicines or procedures. This is because their platelets usually are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia).\n                \nAlso, secondary thrombocytosis is less likely than primary thrombocythemia to cause serious problems related to blood clots and bleeding."

            "answer": "Vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis) is a condition that involves inflammation in the blood vessels. The condition occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake. This may happen as the result of an infection, a medicine, or another disease or condition.\n                \nInflammation refers to the bodys response to injury, including injury to the blood vessels. Inflammation may involve pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and loss of function in the affected tissues.\n                \nIn vasculitis, inflammation can lead to serious problems. Complications depend on which blood vessels, organs, or other body systems are affected.\n                \nOverview\n                \nVasculitis can affect any of the body's blood vessels. These include arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood from your heart to your body's organs. Veins carry blood from your organs and limbs back to your heart. Capillaries connect the small arteries and veins.\n                \nIf a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off. This limits or prevents blood flow through the vessel. Rarely, the blood vessel will stretch and weaken, causing it to bulge. This bulge is known as an aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\n                \nVasculitis\n                \n\n                \nThe disruption in blood flow caused by inflammation can damage the body's organs. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs have been damaged and the extent of the damage.\n                \nTypical symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and general aches and pains, are common among people who have vasculitis.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThere are many types of vasculitis, but overall the condition is rare.

In some cases, vasculitis may go into remission. \"Remission\" means the condition isn't active, but it can come back, or \"flare,\" at any time.\n                \nSometimes vasculitis is chronic (ongoing) and never goes into remission. Long-term treatment with medicines often can control the signs and symptoms of chronic vasculitis.\n                \nRarely, vasculitis doesn't respond well to treatment. This can lead to disability and even death.\n                \nMuch is still unknown about vasculitis. However, researchers continue to learn more about the condition and its various types, causes, and treatments."

These tests may look at:\n                \nHemoglobin and hematocrit. A low hemoglobin or hematocrit level suggests anemia, a complication of vasculitis. Vasculitis can interfere with the body's ability to make enough red blood cells. Vasculitis also can be linked to increased destruction of red blood cells.\n                \nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). These antibodies are present in people who have certain types of vasculitis.\n                \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR may be a sign of inflammation in the body.\n                \nThe amount of C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. A high CRP level suggests inflammation.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nA biopsy often is the best way for your doctor to make a firm diagnosis of vasculitis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of your body tissue to study under a microscope. He or she will take the tissue sample from a blood vessel or an organ.\n                \nA pathologist will study the sample for signs of inflammation or tissue damage. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.\n                \nBlood Pressure\n                \nPeople who have vasculitis should have their blood pressure checked routinely. Vasculitis that damages the kidneys can cause high blood pressure.\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nFor this test, you'll provide a urine sample for analysis.

Abnormal chest x-ray results may show whether vasculitis is affecting your lungs or your large arteries (such as the aorta or the pulmonary arteries).\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\n                \nLung function tests can help your doctor find out whether airflow into and out of your lungs is restricted or blocked.\n                \nAbdominal Ultrasound\n                \nAn abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs and structures in your abdomen. The picture may show whether vasculitis is affecting your abdominal organs.\n                \nComputed Tomography Scan\n                \nA computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or CT scan, is a type of x ray that creates more detailed pictures of your internal organs than a standard x ray. The results from this test can show whether you have a type of vasculitis that affects your abdominal organs or blood vessels.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\n                \nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your internal organs.\n                \nOther Advanced Imaging Techniques\n                \nSeveral new imaging techniques are now being used to help diagnose vasculitis. Duplex ultrasonography combines an image of the structure of the blood vessel with a color image of the blood flow through that vein or artery. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) identifies areas that show higher glucose metabolism leading to problems in the blood vessels.\n                \nAngiography\n                \nAngiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n                \nThe dye is injected into your bloodstream. Special x-ray pictures are taken while the dye flows through your blood vessels. The dye helps highlight the vessels on the x-ray pictures.\n                \nDoctors use angiography to help find out whether blood vessels are narrowed, swollen, deformed, or blocked."

It's a rare and serious condition that mostly affects children.\n                \nChildren who have Fanconi syndrome pass large amounts of key nutrients and chemicals through their urine. These children may have serious health and developmental problems.\n                \nBone Marrow and Blood\n                \nBone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body. Healthy bone marrow contains stem cells that develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs:\n                \nRed blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.\n                \nWhite blood cells, which help fight infections.\n                \nPlatelets (PLATE-lets), which help your blood clot.\n                \nIt's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than 1 day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.\n                \nIf your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells to replace the ones that die, serious health problems can occur.\n                \nFanconi Anemia and Your Body\n                \nFA is one of many types of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nFA is a type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells. Low levels of the three types of blood cells can harm many of the body's organs, tissues, and systems.\n                \nWith too few red blood cells, your body's tissues won't get enough oxygen to work well. With too few white blood cells, your body may have problems fighting infections. This can make you sick more often and make infections worse. With too few platelets, your blood cant clot normally. As a result, you may have bleeding problems.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPeople who have FA have a greater risk than other people for some cancers. About 10percent of people who have FA develop leukemia.\n                \nPeople who have FA and survive to adulthood are much more likely than others to develop cancerous solid tumors.\n                \nThe risk of solid tumors increases with age in people who have FA. These tumors can develop in the mouth, tongue, throat, or esophagus (eh-SOF-ah-gus). (The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.)\n                \nWomen who have FA are at much greater risk than other women of developing tumors in the reproductive organs.\n                \nFA is an unpredictable disease. The average lifespan for people who have FA is between 20 and 30 years. The most common causes of death related to FA are bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors.\n                \nAdvances in care and treatment have improved the chances of surviving longer with FA. Blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the major advance in treatment. However, even with this treatment, the risk of some cancers is greater in people who have FA."

            "question": "What causes Fanconi Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease. The term inherited means that the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs when both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\n                \nPeople who have only one faulty FA gene are FA \"carriers.\" Carriers don't have FA, but they can pass the faulty gene to their children.\n                \nIf both of your parents have a faulty FA gene, you have:\n                \nA 25 percent chance of having FA\n                \nA 25 percent chance of not having FA\n                \nA 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have\n                \nIf only one of your parents has a faulty FA gene, you won't have the disorder.

            "answer": "Fanconi anemia (FA) occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally.\n                \nIn the United States, about 1 out of every 181 people is an FA carrier. This carrier rate leads to about 1 in 130,000 people being born with FA.\n                \nTwo ethnic groups, Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners, are more likely than other groups to have FA or be FA carriers.\n                \nAshkenazi Jews are people who are descended from the Jewish population of Eastern Europe. Afrikaners are White natives of South Africa who speak a language called Afrikaans. This ethnic group is descended from early Dutch, French, and German settlers.\n                \nIn the United States, 1 out of 90 Ashkenazi Jews is an FA carrier, and 1 out of 30,000 is born with FA.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nFA is an inherited diseasethat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs if both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\n                \nChildren born into families with histories of FA are at risk of inheriting the disorder. Children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of FA are at even greater risk. A family history of FA means that it's possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder.\n                \nChildren whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting FA. Even if these children aren't born with FA, they're still at risk of being FA carriers.\n                \nChildren who have only one parent who carries a faulty FA gene also are at risk of being carriers.

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Fanconi Anemia ?",
            "answer": "Major Signs and Symptoms\n                \nYour doctor may suspect you or your child has Fanconi anemia (FA) if you have signs and symptoms of:\n                \nAnemia\n                \nBone marrow failure\n                \nBirth defects\n                \nDevelopmental or eating problems\n                \nFA is an inherited disorderthat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. If a child has FA, his or her brothers and sisters also should be tested for the disorder.\n                \nAnemia\n                \nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts. If you have anemia, you may not have the energy to do normal activities.\n                \nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain.\n                \nBone Marrow Failure\n                \nWhen your bone marrow fails, it can't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can cause many problems that have various signs and symptoms.\n                \nWith too few red blood cells, you can develop anemia. In FA, the size of your red blood cells also can be much larger than normal. This makes it harder for the cells to work well.\n                \nWith too few white blood cells, you're at risk for infections. Infections also may last longer and be more serious than normal.\n                \nWith too few platelets, you may bleed and bruise easily, suffer from internal bleeding, or have petechiae (pe-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae are tiny red or purple spots on the skin. Bleeding in small blood vessels just below your skin causes these spots.\n                \nIn some people who have FA, the bone marrow makes a lot of harmful, immature white blood cells called blasts. Blasts don't work like normal blood cells. As they build up, they prevent the bone marrow from making enough normal blood cells.\n                \nA large number of blasts in the bone marrow can lead to a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nMany birth defects can be signs of FA. These include:\n                \nBone or skeletal defects. FA can cause missing, oddly shaped, or three or more thumbs. Arm bones, hips, legs, hands, and toes may not form fully or normally. People who have FA may have a curved spine, a condition called scoliosis (sco-le-O-sis).\n                \nEye and ear defects. The eyes, eyelids, and ears may not have a normal shape. Children who have FA also might be born deaf.\n                \nSkin discoloration. This includes coffee-colored areas or odd-looking patches of lighter skin.\n                \nKidney problems. A child who has FA might be born with a missing kidney or kidneys that aren't shaped normally.\n                \nCongenital heart defects. The most common congenital heart defect linked to FA is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). A VSD is a hole or defect in the lower part of the wall that separates the hearts left and right chambers.\n                \nDevelopmental Problems\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of FA are related to physical and mental development. They include:\n                \nLow birth weight\n                \nPoor appetite\n                \nDelayed growth\n                \nBelow-average height\n                \nSmall head size\n                \nMental retardation or learning disabilities\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia in Adults\n                \nSome signs and symptoms of FA may develop as you or your child gets older. Women who have FA may have some or all of the following:\n                \nSex organs that are less developed than normal\n                \nMenstruating later than women who don't have FA\n                \nStarting menopause earlier than women who don't have FA\n                \nProblems getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to full term\n                \nMen who have FA may have sex organs that are less developed than normal. They also may be less fertile than men who don't have the disease."

            "question": "How to diagnose Fanconi Anemia ?",
            "answer": "People who have Fanconi anemia (FA) are born with the disorder. They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth. For this reason, FA isn't always diagnosed when a person is born. In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years.\n                \nThe tests used to diagnose FA depend on a person's age and symptoms. In all cases, medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA. However, because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases, only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nA geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nGeneticists do genetic testing for FA. They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal (before birth) testing used to diagnose it.\n                \nAn obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women.\n                \nAfter your child is born, a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens.\n                \nA hematologist (blood disease specialist) also may help diagnose FA.\n                \nFamily and Medical Histories\n                \nFA is an inherited disease. Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA, even if they don't have the disease.\n                \nOther parents, especially if they're FA carriers, may not be aware of a family history of FA. Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children.\n                \nKnowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you, your siblings, or your children have FA, he or she may ask you detailed questions about:\n                \nAny personal or family history of anemia\n                \nAny surgeries youve had related to the digestive system\n                \nAny personal or family history of immune disorders\n                \nYour appetite, eating habits, and any medicines you take\n                \nIf you know your family has a history of FA, or if your answers to your doctor's questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA, your doctor will recommend further testing.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of FA aren't unique to the disease. They're also linked to many other diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. For this reason, genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA. Genetic tests for FA include the following.\n                \nChromosome Breakage Test\n                \nThis is the most common test for FA. It's available only in special laboratories (labs). It shows whether your chromosomes (long chains of genes) break more easily than normal.\n                \nSkin cells sometimes are used for the test. Usually, though, a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle. A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals.\n                \nIf you have FA, the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.\n                \nCytometric Flow Analysis\n                \nCytometric flow analysis, or CFA, is done in a lab. This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide. Skin cells are used for this test.\n                \nA technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally. If you have FA, your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals.\n                \nThe chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.\n                \nMutation Screening\n                \nA mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes. Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes, usually using a sample of your skin cells. With special equipment and lab processes, they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA.\n                \nDiagnosing Different Age Groups\n                \nBefore Birth (Prenatal)\n                \nIf your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant, your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA.\n                \nTwo tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus: amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Both tests are done in a doctor's office or hospital.\n                \nAmniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus. A technician tests chromosomes (chains of genes) from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA.\n                \nCVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta (the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother).\n                \nThe doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA.\n                \nAt Birth\n                \nThree out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects. If your baby is born with certain birth defects, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA.\n                \nFor more information about these defects, go to What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia?\n                \nChildhood and Later\n                \nSome people who have FA are not born with birth defects. Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur. This usually happens within the first 10 years of life.\n                \nSigns of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages. However, 10 percent of children who have FA aren't diagnosed until after 16 years of age.\n                \nIf your bone marrow is failing, you may have signs of aplastic anemia. FA is one type of aplastic anemia.\n                \nIn aplastic anemia, your bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n                \nAplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals, radiation, or medicines.\n                \nDoctors diagnose aplastic anemia using:\n                \nFamily and medical histories and a physical exam.\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) to check the number, size, and condition of your red blood cells. The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets.\n                \nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate.\n                \nBone marrow tests. For a bone marrow aspiration, a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells.\n                \nIf you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, your doctor will want to find the cause. If your doctor suspects you have FA, he or she may recommend genetic testing.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Aplastic Anemia article."

            "answer": "Doctors decide how to treat Fanconi anemia (FA) based on a person's age and how well the person's bone marrow is making new blood cells.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nLong-term treatments for FA can:\n                \nCure the anemia. Damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own.\n                \nOr\n                \nTreat the symptoms without curing the cause. This is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time.\n                \nScreening and Short-Term Treatment\n                \nEven if you or your child has FA, your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells. If so, your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition.\n                \nYour doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year. He or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors.\n                \nIf your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low, your bone marrow might be failing. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections. In the short term, he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels.\n                \nHowever, long-term use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work.\n                \nLong-Term Treatment\n                \nThe four main types of long-term treatment for FA are:\n                \nBlood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nAndrogen therapy\n                \nSynthetic growth factors\n                \nGene therapy\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have FA that's causing major bone marrow failure. Healthy stem cells from another person, called a donor, are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow.\n                \nIf you're going to receive stem cells from another person, your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible.\n                \nStem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who:\n                \nHave few or no serious health problems\n                \nReceive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match \n                \nHave had few or no previous blood transfusions\n                \nDuring the transplant, you'll get donated stem cells in a procedure that's like a blood transfusion. Once the new stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\n                \nA successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells.\n                \nEven if you've had a stem cell transplant to treat FA, youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors. Your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure.\n                \nFor more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor, having the procedure, and learning about the risksgo to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\n                \nAndrogen Therapy\n                \nBefore improvements made stem cell transplants more effective, androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had FA. Androgens are man-made male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods.\n                \nAndrogens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts. They don't work as well at raising your white blood cell count.\n                \nUnlike a stem cell transplant, androgens don't allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own. You may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of FA.\n                \nAlso, over time, androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells, which means you'll need other treatments.\n                \nAndrogen therapy can have serious side effects, such as liver disease. This treatment also can't prevent you from developing leukemia (a type of blood cancer).\n                \nSynthetic Growth Factors\n                \nYour doctor may choose to treat your FA with growth factors. These are substances found in your body, but they also can be man-made.\n                \nGrowth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells. Growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied.\n                \nMore research is needed on growth factor treatment for FA. Early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens.\n                \nGene Therapy\n                \nResearchers are looking for ways to replace faulty FA genes with normal, healthy genes. They hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells. Early results of this therapy hold promise, but more research is needed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nFA can cause birth defects that affect the arms, thumbs, hips, legs, and other parts of the body. Doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects.\n                \nFor example, your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. His or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly.\n                \nChildren who have FA also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition, growth, and survival.\n                \nOne of the most common problems is an FA-related birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe), which carries air to the lungs, is connected to the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach.\n                \nThis can cause serious breathing, swallowing, and eating problems and can lead to lung infections. Surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing."

If a child gets two copies of the same faulty FA gene, he or she will have the disease.\n                \nIf you're at high risk for FA and are planning to have children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has FA. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you.\n                \nIf you're already pregnant, genetic testing can show whether your child has FA. For more information on genetic testing, go to \"How Is Fanconi Anemia Diagnosed?\"\n                \nIn the United States, Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of Eastern European descent) are at higher risk for FA than other ethnic groups. For Ashkenazi Jews, it's recommended that prospective parents get tested for FA-related gene mutations before getting pregnant.\n                \nPreventing Complications\n                \nIf you or your child has FA, you can prevent some health problems related to the disorder. Pneumonia, hepatitis, and chicken pox can occur more often and more severely in people who have FA compared with those who don't. Ask your doctor about vaccines for these conditions.\n                \nPeople who have FA also are at higher risk than other people for some cancers. These cancers include leukemia (a type of blood cancer), myelodysplastic syndrome (abnormal levels of all three types of blood cells), and liver cancer. Screening and early detection can help manage these life-threatening diseases."

            "question": "What is (are) Arrhythmia ?",
            "answer": "Espaol\n                \nAn arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah) is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\n                \nA heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah).\n                \nMost arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious or even life threatening. During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.\n                \nUnderstanding the Heart's Electrical System\n                \nTo understand arrhythmias, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\n                \nEach electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the heart's upper right chamber, the right atrium (AY-tree-um). In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute.\n                \nFrom the SA node, the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria. This causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls).\n                \nThe electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down just a little, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.\n                \nThe electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels along a pathway called the bundle of His. This pathway divides into a right bundle branch and a left bundle branch. The signal goes down these branches to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.\n                \nThe ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node. (For more information about the heart's electrical system, including detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.)\n                \nA problem with any part of this process can cause an arrhythmia. For example, in atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), a common type of arrhythmia, electrical signals travel through the atria in a fast and disorganized way. This causes the atria to quiver instead of contract.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThere are many types of arrhythmia. Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some are not. The outlook for a person who has an arrhythmia depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia.\n                \nEven serious arrhythmias often can be successfully treated. Most people who have arrhythmias are able to live normal, healthy lives."

            "question": "What causes Arrhythmia ?",
            "answer": "An arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked. This can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals don't work properly. It also can happen if the electrical signals don't travel normally through the heart.\n                \nAn arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals. This adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat.\n                \nSmoking, heavy alcohol use, use of some drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), use of some prescription or over-the-counter medicines, or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people.\n                \nStrong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder, raise blood pressure, and release stress hormones. Sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias.\n                \nA heart attack or other condition that damages the heart's electrical system also can cause arrhythmias. Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, an overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone produced), and rheumatic heart disease.\n                \nCongenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects can cause some arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The term \"congenital means the defect is present at birth.\n                \nSometimes the cause of arrhythmias is unknown."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Arrhythmia? ?",
            "answer": "Arrhythmias are very common in older adults. Atrial fibrillation (a common type of arrhythmia that can cause problems) affects millions of people, and the number is rising.\n                \nMost serious arrhythmias affect people older than 60. This is because older adults are more likely to have heart disease and other health problems that can lead to arrhythmias.\n                \nOlder adults also tend to be more sensitive to the side effects of medicines, some of which can cause arrhythmias. Some medicines used to treat arrhythmias can even cause arrhythmias as a side effect.\n                \nSome types of arrhythmia happen more often in children and young adults. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, is more common in young people. PSVT is a fast heart rate that begins and ends suddenly.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nArrhythmias are more common in people who have diseases or conditions that weaken the heart, such as:\n                \nHeart attack\n                \nHeart failure or cardiomyopathy, which weakens the heart and changes the way electrical signals move through the heart\n                \nHeart tissue that's too thick or stiff or that hasn't formed normally\n                \nLeaking or narrowed heart valves, which make the heart work too hard and can lead to heart failure\n                \nCongenital heart defects (defects present at birth) that affect the heart's structure or function\n                \nOther conditions also can raise the risk for arrhythmias, such as:\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nInfections that damage the heart muscle or the sac around the heart\n                \nDiabetes, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease\n                \nSleep apnea, which can stress the heart because the heart doesn't get enough oxygen\n                \nAn overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)\n                \nSeveral other risk factors also can raise your risk for arrhythmias. Examples include heart surgery, certain drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), or an imbalance of chemicals or other substances (such as potassium) in the bloodstream."

            "question": "How to diagnose Arrhythmia ?",
            "answer": "Arrhythmias can be hard to diagnose, especially the types that only cause symptoms every once in a while. Doctors diagnose arrhythmias based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nDoctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases include:\n                \nCardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems.\n                \nPediatric cardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat babies, children, and youth who have heart problems.\n                \nElectrophysiologists. These doctors are cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nTo diagnose an arrhythmia, your doctor may ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she may ask whether you feel fluttering in your chest and whether you feel dizzy or light-headed.\n                \nYour doctor also may ask whether you have other health problems, such as a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems. He or she may ask about your family's medical history, including whether anyone in your family:\n                \nHas a history of arrhythmias\n                \nHas ever had heart disease or high blood pressure\n                \nHas died suddenly\n                \nHas other illnesses or health problems\n                \nYour doctor will likely want to know what medicines you're taking, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements.\n                \nYour doctor may ask about your health habits, such as physical activity, smoking, or using alcohol or drugs (for example, cocaine). He or she also may want to know whether you've had emotional stress or anger.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring a physical exam, your doctor may:\n                \nListen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat\n                \nListen to your heart for a heart murmur (an extra or unusual sound heard during your heartbeat)\n                \nCheck your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating\n                \nCheck for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure\n                \nLook for signs of other diseases, such as thyroid disease, that could be causing the problem\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It's the most common test used to diagnose arrhythmias.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect arrhythmias that don't happen during the test.\n                \nTo diagnose arrhythmias that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nA Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nFor many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nSome event monitors are able to send data about your heart's electrical activity to a central monitoring station. Technicians at the station review the information and send it to your doctor. You also can use the device to report any symptoms you're having.\n                \nYou can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests also are used to help diagnose arrhythmias.\n                \nBlood tests. Blood tests check the level of substances in the blood, such as potassium and thyroid hormone. Abnormal levels of these substances can increase your chances of having an arrhythmia.\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged.\n                \nEchocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. Echocardiography (echo) provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nThe test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test (see below). A stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n                \nA transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach.\n                \nStress test. Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nThe heart tests done during stress testing may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.\n                \nElectrophysiology study (EPS). This test is used to assess serious arrhythmias. During an EPS, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals.\n                \nYour doctor can use the wire to electrically stimulate your heart and trigger an arrhythmia. This allows your doctor to see whether an antiarrhythmia medicine can stop the problem.\n                \nCatheter ablation, a procedure used to treat some arrhythmias, may be done during an EPS.\n                \nTilt table testing. This test sometimes is used to help find the cause of fainting spells. You lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position. The change in position may cause you to faint.\n                \nYour doctor watches your symptoms, heart rate, EKG reading, and blood pressure throughout the test. He or she may give you medicine and then check your response to the medicine.\n                \nCoronary angiography. Coronary angiography uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. This helps your doctor find blockages that can cause a heart attack.\n                \nImplantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms. Minor surgery is used to place this device under the skin in the chest area.\n                \nAn implantable loop recorder helps doctors figure out why a person may be having palpitations or fainting spells, especially if these symptoms don't happen very often. The device can be used for as long as 12 to 24 months."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Arrhythmia ?",
            "answer": "Common arrhythmia treatments include medicines, medical procedures, and surgery. Your doctor may recommend treatment if your arrhythmia causes serious symptoms, such as dizziness, chest pain, or fainting.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend treatment if the arrhythmia increases your risk for problems such as heart failure, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines can slow down a heart that's beating too fast. They also can change an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal, steady rhythm. Medicines that do this are called antiarrhythmics.\n                \nSome of the medicines used to slow a fast heart rate are beta blockers (such as metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil), and digoxin (digitalis). These medicines often are used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF).\n                \nSome of the medicines used to restore a normal heart rhythm are amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, ibutilide, quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. These medicines often have side effects. Some side effects can make an arrhythmia worse or even cause a different kind of arrhythmia.\n                \nCurrently, no medicine can reliably speed up a slow heart rate. Abnormally slow heart rates are treated with pacemakers.\n                \nPeople who have AF and some other arrhythmias may be treated with blood-thinning medicines. These medicines reduce the risk of blood clots forming. Warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin are examples of blood-thinning medicines.\n                \nMedicines also can control an underlying medical condition that might be causing an arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a thyroid condition.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nSome arrhythmias are treated with pacemakers. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nPacemakers have sensors that detect the heart's electrical activity. When the device senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it sends electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n                \nSome arrhythmias are treated with a jolt of electricity to the heart. This type of treatment is called cardioversion or defibrillation, depending on which type of arrhythmia is being treated.\n                \nSome people who are at risk for ventricular fibrillation are treated with a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Like a pacemaker, an ICD is a small device that's placed under the skin in the chest. This device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control life-threatening arrhythmias.\n                \nAn ICD continuously monitors the heartbeat. If it senses a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, it sends an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.\n                \nA procedure called catheter ablation is used to treat some arrhythmias if medicines don't work. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. Then, the tube is guided to your heart.\n                \nA special machine sends energy through the tube to your heart. The energy finds and destroys small areas of heart tissue where abnormal heart rhythms may start. Catheter ablation usually is done in a hospital as part of an electrophysiology study.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography before catheter ablation to make sure no blood clots are present in the atria (the heart's upper chambers).\n                \nSurgery\n                \nDoctors treat some arrhythmias with surgery. This may occur if surgery is already being done for another reason, such as repair of a heart valve.\n                \nOne type of surgery for AF is called maze surgery. During this surgery, a surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals.\n                \nIf coronary heart disease is the cause of your arrhythmia, your doctor may recommend coronary artery bypass grafting. This surgery improves blood flow to the heart muscle.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nVagal maneuvers are another type of treatment for arrhythmia. These simple exercises sometimes can stop or slow down certain types of supraventricular arrhythmias. They do this by affecting the vagus nerve, which helps control the heart rate.\n                \nSome vagal maneuvers include:\n                \nGagging\n                \nHolding your breath and bearing down (Valsalva maneuver)\n                \nImmersing your face in ice-cold water\n                \nCoughing\n                \nPutting your fingers on your eyelids and pressing down gently\n                \nVagal maneuvers aren't an appropriate treatment for everyone. Discuss with your doctor whether vagal maneuvers are an option for you."

            "question": "What is (are) Endocarditis ?",
            "answer": "Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).\n                \nThe term \"endocarditis\" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.\n                \nIE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.\n                \nIE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.\n                \nOverview\n                \nIE mainly affects people who have:\n                \nDamaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves\n                \nCongenital heart defects (defects present at birth)\n                \nImplanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels\n                \nPeople who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.\n                \nCertain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection.\n                \nOther risk factors include using intravenous (IV) drugs, having a catheter (tube) or another medical device in your body for long periods, and having a history of IE.\n                \nCommon symptoms of IE are fever and other flu-like symptoms. Because the infection can affect people in different ways, the signs and symptoms vary. IE also can cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart.\n                \nIf you're at high risk for IE, seek medical care if you have signs or symptoms of the infection, especially a fever that persists or unexplained fatigue (tiredness).\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIE is treated with antibiotics for several weeks. You also may need heart surgery to repair or replace heart valves or remove infected heart tissue.\n                \nMost people who are treated with the proper antibiotics recover. But if the infection isn't treated, or if it persists despite treatment (for example, if the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics), it's usually fatal.\n                \nIf you have signs or symptoms of IE, see your doctor as soon as you can, especially if you have abnormal heart valves."

            "answer": "Infective endocarditis (IE) occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. Certain factors increase the risk of this happening.\n                \nA common underlying factor in IE is a structural heart defect, especially faulty heart valves. Usually your immune system will kill germs in your bloodstream. However, if your heart has a rough lining or abnormal valves, the invading germs can attach and multiply in the heart.\n                \nOther factors also can play a role in causing IE. Common activities, such as brushing your teeth or having certain dental procedures, can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. This is even more likely to happen if your teeth and gums are in poor condition.\n                \nHaving a catheter (tube) or another medical device inserted through your skin, especially for long periods, also can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. People who use intravenous (IV) drugs also are at risk for IE because of the germs on needles and syringes.\n                \nBacteria also may spread to the blood and heart from infections in other parts of the body, such as the gut, skin, or genitals.\n                \nEndocarditis Complications\n                \nAs the bacteria or other germs multiply in your heart, they form clumps with other cells and matter found in the blood. These clumps are called vegetations (vej-eh-TA-shuns).\n                \nAs IE worsens, pieces of the vegetations can break off and travel to almost any other organ or tissue in the body. There, the pieces can block blood flow or cause a new infection. As a result, IE can cause a range of complications.\n                \nHeart Complications\n                \nHeart problems are the most common complication of IE. They occur in one-third to one-half of all people who have the infection. These problems may include a new heart murmur, heart failure, heart valve damage, heart block, or, rarely, a heart attack.\n                \nCentral Nervous System Complications\n                \nThese complications occur in as many as 20 to 40 percent of people who have IE. Central nervous system complications most often occur when bits of the vegetation, called emboli (EM-bo-li), break away and lodge in the brain.\n                \nThe emboli can cause local infections called brain abscesses. Or, they can cause a more widespread brain infection called meningitis (men-in-JI-tis).\n                \nEmboli also can cause strokes or seizures. This happens if they block blood vessels or affect the brain's electrical signals. These complications can cause long-term damage to the brain and may even be fatal.\n                \nComplications in Other Organs\n                \nIE also can affect other organs in the body, such as the lungs, kidneys, and spleen.\n                \nLungs. The lungs are especially at risk when IE affects the right side of the heart. This is called right-sided infective endocarditis.\n                \nA vegetation or blood clot going to the lungs can cause a pulmonary embolism (PE) and lung damage. A PE is a sudden blockage in a lung artery.\n                \nOther lung complications include pneumonia and a buildup of fluid or pus around the lungs.\n                \nKidneys. IE can cause kidney abscesses and kidney damage. The infection also can inflame the internal filtering structures of the kidneys.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of kidney complications include back or side pain, blood in the urine, or a change in the color or amount of urine. In some cases, IE can cause kidney failure.\n                \nSpleen. The spleen is an organ located in the left upper part of the abdomen near the stomach. In some people who have IE, the spleen enlarges (especially in people who have long-term IE). Sometimes emboli also can damage the spleen.\n                \nSigns and symptoms of spleen problems include pain or discomfort in the upper left abdomen and/or left shoulder, a feeling of fullness or the inability to eat large meals, and hiccups."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Endocarditis? ?",
            "answer": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon condition that can affect both children and adults. It's more common in men than women.\n                \nIE typically affects people who have abnormal hearts or other conditions that put them at risk for the infection. Sometimes IE does affect people who were healthy before the infection.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nThe germs that cause IE tend to attach and multiply on damaged, malformed, or artificial (man-made) heart valves and implanted medical devices. Certain conditions put you at higher risk for IE. These include:\n                \nCongenital heart defects (defects that are present at birth). Examples include a malformed heart or abnormal heart valves.\n                \nArtificial heart valves, an implanted medical device in the heart (such as a pacemaker wire), or an intravenous (IV) catheter (tube) in a blood vessel for a long time.\n                \nHeart valves damaged by rheumatic fever or calcium deposits that cause age-related valve thickening. Scars in the heart from a previous case of IE also can damage heart valves.\n                \nIV drug use, especially if needles are shared or reused, contaminated substances are injected, or the skin isn't properly cleaned before injection."

            "question": "How to diagnose Endocarditis ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose infective endocarditis (IE) based on your risk factors, your medical history and signs and symptoms, and test results.\n                \nDiagnosis of IE often is based on many factors, rather than a single positive test result, sign, or symptom.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood cultures are the most important blood tests used to diagnose IE. Blood is drawn several times over a 24-hour period. It's put in special culture bottles that allow bacteria to grow.\n                \nDoctors then identify and test the bacteria to see which antibiotics will kill them. Sometimes the blood cultures don't grow any bacteria, even if a person has IE. This is called culture-negative endocarditis, and it requires antibiotic treatment.\n                \nOther blood tests also are used to diagnose IE. For example, a complete blood count may be used to check the number of red and white blood cells in your blood. Blood tests also may be used to check your immune system and to check for inflammation.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. Two types of echo are useful in diagnosing IE.\n                \nTransthoracic (tranz-thor-AS-ik) echo. For this painless test, gel is applied to the skin on your chest. A device called a transducer is moved around on the outside of your chest.\n                \nThis device sends sound waves called ultrasound through your chest. As the ultrasound waves bounce off your heart, a computer converts them into pictures on a screen.\n                \nYour doctor uses the pictures to look for vegetations, areas of infected tissue (such as an abscess), and signs of heart damage.\n                \nBecause the sound waves have to pass through skin, muscle, tissue, bone, and lungs, the pictures may not have enough detail. Thus, your doctor may recommend transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE).\n                \nTransesophageal echo. For TEE, a much smaller transducer is attached to the end of a long, narrow, flexible tube. The tube is passed down your throat. Before the procedure, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine.\n                \nThe doctor then passes the transducer down your esophagus (the passage from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, the transducer can get detailed pictures of the heart's structures.\n                \nEKG\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating, whether your heart rhythm is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nAn EKG typically isn't used to diagnose IE. However, it may be done to see whether IE is affecting your heart's electrical activity.\n                \nFor this test, soft, sticky patches called electrodes are attached to your chest, arms, and legs. You lie still while the electrodes detect your heart's electrical signals. A machine records these signals on graph paper or shows them on a computer screen. The entire test usually takes about 10 minutes."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Endocarditis ?",
            "answer": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is treated with antibiotics and sometimes with heart surgery.\n                \nAntibiotics\n                \nAntibiotics usually are given for 2 to 6 weeks through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. You're often in a hospital for at least the first week or more of treatment. This allows your doctor to make sure the medicine is helping.\n                \nIf you're allowed to go home before the treatment is done, the antibiotics are almost always continued by vein at home. You'll need special care if you get IV antibiotic treatment at home. Before you leave the hospital, your medical team will arrange for you to receive home-based care so you can continue your treatment.\n                \nYou also will need close medical followup, usually by a team of doctors. This team often includes a doctor who specializes in infectious diseases, a cardiologist (heart specialist), and a heart surgeon.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or to help clear up IE. For example, IE caused by fungi often requires surgery. This is because this type of IE is harder to treat than IE caused by bacteria."

            "question": "What is (are) Aneurysm ?",
            "answer": "An aneurysm (AN-u-rism) is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your body.\n                \nArteries have thick walls to withstand normal blood pressure. However, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or injure artery walls. The force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm.\n                \nAn aneurysm can grow large and rupture (burst) or dissect. A rupture causes dangerous bleeding inside the body. A dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. The split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall.\n                \nBoth rupture and dissection often are fatal.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMost aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. The aorta goes through the chest and abdomen.\n                \nAn aneurysm that occurs in the chest portion of the aorta is called a thoracic (tho-RAS-ik) aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm that occurs in the abdominal portion of the aorta is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n                \nAneurysms also can occur in other arteries, but these types of aneurysm are less common. This article focuses on aortic aneurysms.\n                \nAbout 13,000 Americans die each year from aortic aneurysms. Most of the deaths result from rupture or dissection.\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection. However, aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms can benefit from early, routine screening.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nDoctors often can successfully treat aortic aneurysms with medicines or surgery if theyre found in time. Medicines may be given to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and reduce the risk of rupture.\n                \nLarge aortic aneurysms often can be repaired with surgery. During surgery, the weak or damaged portion of the aorta is replaced or reinforced."

Examples include aging, smoking, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to the buildup of a waxy substance called plaque (plak).\n                \nRarely, infectionssuch as untreated syphilis (a sexually transmitted infection)can cause aortic aneurysms. Aortic aneurysms also can occur as a result of diseases that inflame the blood vessels, such as vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis).\n                \nA family history of aneurysms also may play a role in causing aortic aneurysms.\n                \nIn addition to the factors above, certain genetic conditions may cause thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Examples of these conditions include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (the vascular type), and Turner syndrome.\n                \nThese genetic conditions can weaken the bodys connective tissues and damage the aorta. People who have these conditions tend to develop aneurysms at a younger age than other people. Theyre also at higher risk for rupture and dissection.\n                \nTrauma, such as a car accident, also can damage the walls of the aorta and lead to TAAs.\n                \nResearchers continue to look for other causes of aortic aneurysms.

Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the medicines most commonly used.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nYour doctor may recommend surgery if your aneurysm is growing quickly or is at risk of rupture or dissection.\n                \nThe two main types of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms are open abdominal or open chest repair and endovascular repair.\n                \nOpen Abdominal or Open Chest Repair\n                \nThe standard and most common type of surgery for aortic aneurysms is open abdominal or open chest repair. This surgery involves a major incision (cut) in the abdomen or chest.\n                \nGeneral anesthesia (AN-es-THE-ze-ah) is used during this procedure. The term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep.\n                \nDuring the surgery, the aneurysm is removed. Then, the section of aorta is replaced with a graft made of material such as Dacron or Teflon. The surgery takes 3 to 6 hours; youll remain in the hospital for 5 to 8 days.\n                \nIf needed, repair of the aortic heart valve also may be done during open abdominal or open chest surgery.\n                \nIt often takes a month to recover from open abdominal or open chest surgery and return to full activity. Most patients make a full recovery.\n                \nEndovascular Repair\n                \nIn endovascular repair, the aneurysm isn't removed. Instead, a graft is inserted into the aorta to strengthen it. Surgeons do this type of surgery using catheters (tubes) inserted into the arteries; it doesn't require surgically opening the chest or abdomen. General anesthesia is used during this procedure.\n                \nThe surgeon first inserts a catheter into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threads it to the aneurysm. Then, using an x ray to see the artery, the surgeon threads the graft (also called a stent graft) into the aorta to the aneurysm.\n                \nThe graft is then expanded inside the aorta and fastened in place to form a stable channel for blood flow. The graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta. This helps prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.\n                \nEndovascular Repair\n                \n\n                \nThe illustration shows the placement of a stent graft in an aortic aneurysm. In figure A, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh). The catheter is threaded to the abdominal aorta, and the stent graft is released from the catheter. In figure B, the stent graft allows blood to flow through the aneurysm.\n                \nThe recovery time for endovascular repair is less than the recovery time for open abdominal or open chest repair. However, doctors cant repair all aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair. The location or size of an aneurysm may prevent the use of a stent graft."

            "question": "How to prevent Aneurysm ?",
            "answer": "The best way to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to avoid the factors that put you at higher risk for one. You cant control all aortic aneurysm risk factors, but lifestyle changes can help you lower some risks.\n                \nFor example, if you smoke, try to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article.\n                \nAnother important lifestyle change is following a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar.\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general information about healthy eating.\n                \nBe as physically active as you can. Talk with your doctor about the amounts and types of physical activity that are safe for you. For more information about physical activity, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBIs \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nWork with your doctor to control medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Follow your treatment plans and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes.\n                \nScreening for Aneurysms\n                \nAlthough you may not be able to prevent an aneurysm, early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection.\n                \nAneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any signs or symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms may benefit from early, routine screening.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend routine screening if youre:\n                \nA man between the ages of 65 and 75 who has ever smoked\n                \nA man or woman between the ages of 65 and 75 who has a family history of aneurysms\n                \nIf youre at risk, but not in one of these high-risk groups, ask your doctor whether screening will benefit you."

            "question": "What is (are) Hemochromatosis ?",
            "answer": "Hemochromatosis (HE-mo-kro-ma-TO-sis) is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body (iron overload). Iron is a mineral found in many foods.\n                \nToo much iron is toxic to your body. It can poison your organs and cause organ failure. In hemochromatosis, iron can build up in most of your body's organs, but especially in the liver, heart, and pancreas.\n                \nToo much iron in the liver can cause an enlarged liver, liver failure, liver cancer, or cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, which causes the organ to not work well.\n                \nToo much iron in the heart can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs) and heart failure. Too much iron in the pancreas can lead to diabetes.\n                \nIf hemochromatosis isn't treated, it may even cause death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. Secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload.\n                \nMost people who have primary hemochromatosis inherit it from their parents. If you inherit two hemochromatosis genesone from each parentyou're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of the disease. The two faulty genes cause your body to absorb more iron than usual from the foods you eat.\n                \nHemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. However, not everyone who has hemochromatosis has signs or symptoms of the disease.\n                \nEstimates of how many people develop signs and symptoms vary greatly. Some estimates suggest that as many as half of all people who have the disease don't have signs or symptoms.\n                \nThe severity of hemochromatosis also varies. Some people don't have complications, even with high levels of iron in their bodies. Others have severe complications or die from the disease.\n                \nCertain factors can affect the severity of the disease. For example, a high intake of vitamin C can make hemochromatosis worse. This is because vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food.\n                \nAlcohol use can worsen liver damage and cirrhosis caused by hemochromatosis. Conditions such as hepatitis also can further damage or weaken the liver.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe outlook for people who have hemochromatosis largely depends on how much organ damage they have at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of the disease are important.\n                \nTreatment may help prevent, delay, or sometimes reverse complications of the disease. Treatment also may lead to better quality of life.\n                \nFor people who are diagnosed and treated early, a normal lifespan is possible. If left untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to severe organ damage and even death."

            "question": "What causes Hemochromatosis ?",
            "answer": "The two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Each type has a different cause.\n                \nPrimary Hemochromatosis\n                \nPrimary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. This form of the disease sometimes is called hereditary or classical hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is more common than the secondary form of the disease.\n                \nThe genes usually involved in primary hemochromatosis are called HFE genes. Faulty HFE genes cause the body to absorb too much iron. If you inherit two copies of the faulty HFE gene (one from each parent), you're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis.\n                \nIf you inherit one faulty HFE gene and one normal HFE gene, you're a hemochromatosis \"carrier.\" Carriers usually don't develop the disease. However, they can pass the faulty gene on to their children. Estimates suggest that about 1 in 10 people in the United States are hemochromatosis carriers.\n                \nIf two parents are carriers of the faulty HFE gene, then each of their children has a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting two faulty HFE genes.\n                \nAlthough less common, other faulty genes also can cause hemochromatosis. Researchers continue to study what changes to normal genes may cause the disease.\n                \nSecondary Hemochromatosis\n                \nSecondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload. Examples of such diseases and conditions include:\n                \nCertain types of anemia, such as thalassemias and sideroblastic anemia\n                \nAtransferrinemia and aceruloplasminemiaboth are rare, inherited diseases\n                \nChronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n                \nOther factors also can cause secondary hemochromatosis, including:\n                \nBlood transfusions\n                \nOral iron pills or iron injections, with or without very high vitamin C intake (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron)\n                \nLong-term kidney dialysis"

The disease is less common in African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians.\n                \nPrimary hemochromatosis is more common in men than in women. Also, older people are more likely to develop the disease than younger people. In fact, signs and symptoms usually don't occur in men until they're 40 to 60 years old.\n                \nIn women, signs and symptoms usually don't occur until after the age of 50 (after menopause). Young children rarely develop hemochromatosis.\n                \nInheriting two faulty HFE genes (one from each parent) is the major risk factor for hemochromatosis. However, many people who have two copies of the faulty gene don't develop signs or symptoms of the disease.\n                \nAlcoholism is another risk factor for hemochromatosis. A family history of certain diseases and conditions also puts you at higher risk for hemochromatosis.

            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nThe disease sometimes is detected while checking for other diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, or erectile dysfunction (impotence).\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nFamily doctors and internal medicine specialists may diagnose and treat hemochromatosis. Other doctors also may be involved in diagnosing and treating the disease, including:\n                \nHematologists (blood disease specialists)\n                \nCardiologists (heart specialists)\n                \nEndocrinologists (gland system specialists)\n                \nHepatologists (liver specialists)\n                \nGastroenterologists (digestive tract specialists)\n                \nRheumatologists (specialists in diseases of the joints and tissues)\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nTo learn about your medical and family histories, your doctor may ask:\n                \nAbout your signs and symptoms, including when they started and their severity.\n                \nWhether you take iron (pills or injections) with or without vitamin C supplements (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food). If so, your doctor may ask how much iron you take. This information can help him or her diagnose secondary hemochromatosis.\n                \nWhether other members of your family have hemochromatosis.\n                \nWhether other members of your family have a history of medical problems or diseases related to hemochromatosis.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. He or she will listen to your heart for irregular heartbeats and check for arthritis, abnormal skin color, and an enlarged liver.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more tests or procedures to diagnose hemochromatosis.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nIn hemochromatosis, the amount of iron in your body may be too high, even though the level of iron in your blood is normal. Certain blood tests can help your doctor find out how much iron is in your body. \n                \nDuring these tests, a sample of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\n                \nThe blood tests you have may include transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin level, and liver function tests.\n                \nTransferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. The TS test shows how much iron the transferrin is carrying. This helps your doctor find out how much iron is in your body.\n                \nYour doctor may test your serum ferritin level if your TS level is high. A serum ferritin level test shows how much iron is stored in your body's organs. A buildup of iron may suggest hemochromatosis.\n                \nYou may have liver function tests to check for damage to your liver. Liver damage may be a sign of hemochromatosis. If you have hemochromatosis, liver function tests may show the severity of the disease.\n                \nBlood tests alone can't diagnose hemochromatosis. Thus, your doctor may recommend other tests as well.\n                \nLiver Biopsy\n                \nDuring a liver biopsy, your doctor numbs an area near your liver and then removes a small sample of liver tissue using a needle. The tissue is then looked at under a microscope.\n                \nA liver biopsy can show how much iron is in your liver. This procedure also can help your doctor diagnose liver damage (for example, scarring and cancer). Liver biopsies are less common now than in the past.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your organs. An MRI may be done to show the amount of iron in your liver.\n                \nSuperconducting Quantum Interference Device\n                \nA superconducting quantum interference device (SQuID) is a machine that uses very sensitive magnets to measure the amount of iron in your liver. This machine is available at only a few medical centers.\n                \nGenetic Testing\n                \nGenetic testing can show whether you have a faulty HFE gene or genes. However, even if you do have two faulty HFE genes, the genetic test can't predict whether you'll develop signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis.\n                \nAlso, genetic testing may not detect other, less common faulty genes that also can cause hemochromatosis.\n                \nThere are two ways to do genetic testing. Cells can be collected from inside your mouth using a cotton swab, or a sample of blood can be drawn from a vein in your arm.\n                \nPeople who have hemochromatosis (or a family history of it) and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling. Testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty HFE genes. A genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children."

A needle is inserted into a vein, and your blood flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag.\n                \nThe process is similar to donating blood; it can be done at blood donation centers, hospital donation centers, or a doctor's office.\n                \nIn the first stage of treatment, about 1 pint of blood is removed once or twice a week. After your iron levels return to normal, you may continue phlebotomy treatments. However, you may need them less oftentypically every 24 months.\n                \nAs long as treatment continues, which often is for the rest of your life, you'll need frequent blood tests to check your iron levels.\n                \nIron Chelation Therapy\n                \nIron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body. This treatment is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal.\n                \nThe medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth).

Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Talk with your doctor about how much vitamin C is safe for you.\n                \nAvoid uncooked fish and shellfish. Some fish and shellfish contain bacteria that can cause infections in people who have chronic diseases, such as hemochromatosis.\n                \nLimit alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver disease. It also can make existing liver disease worse.\n                \nTreatment for Complications\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe other treatments as needed for complications such as liver disease, heart problems, or diabetes."

            "answer": "Thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).\n                \nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot) to stop any bleeding that may happen if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a clot also is called a thrombus.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWhen your blood has too few platelets, mild to serious bleeding can occur. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding).\n                \nA normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. If your blood platelet count falls below normal, you have thrombocytopenia.\n                \nHowever, the risk for serious bleeding doesn't occur until the count becomes very lowless than 10,000 or 20,000 platelets per microliter. Mild bleeding sometimes occurs when the count is less than 50,000 platelets per microliter.\n                \nMany factors can cause a low platelet count, such as:\n                \nThe body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets.\n                \nThe bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.\n                \nThe spleen holds on to too many platelets. The spleen is an organ that normally stores about one-third of the body's platelets. It also helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted cell material.\n                \nA combination of the above factors.\n                \nHow long thrombocytopenia lasts depends on its cause. It can last from days to years.\n                \nThe treatment for this condition also depends on its cause and severity. Mild thrombocytopenia often doesn't require treatment. If the condition causes or puts you at risk for serious bleeding, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions. Rarely, the spleen may need to be removed.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThrombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if the bleeding is severe or occurs in the brain. However, the overall outlook for people who have the condition is good, especially if the cause of the low platelet count is found and treated."

            "question": "What causes Thrombocytopenia ?",
            "answer": "Many factors can cause thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count). The condition can be inherited or acquired. \"Inherited\" means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia isn't known.\n                \nIn general, a low platelet count occurs because:\n                \nThe body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets.\n                \nThe bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.\n                \nThe spleen holds on to too many platelets.\n                \nA combination of the above factors also may cause a low platelet count.\n                \nThe Bone Marrow Doesn't Make Enough Platelets\n                \nBone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. When stem cells are damaged, they don't grow into healthy blood cells.\n                \nMany conditions and factors can damage stem cells.\n                \nCancer\n                \nCancer, such as leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or lymphoma (lim-FO-ma), can damage the bone marrow and destroy blood stem cells. Cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also destroy the stem cells.\n                \nAplastic Anemia\n                \nAplastic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder in which the bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells. This lowers the number of platelets in your blood.\n                \nToxic Chemicals\n                \nExposure to toxic chemicalssuch as pesticides, arsenic, and benzenecan slow the production of platelets.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSome medicines, such as diuretics and chloramphenicol, can slow the production of platelets. Chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) rarely is used in the United States.\n                \nCommon over-the-counter medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, also can affect platelets.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nAlcohol also slows the production of platelets. A temporary drop in the platelet count is common among heavy drinkers, especially if they're eating foods that are low in iron, vitamin B12, or folate.\n                \nViruses\n                \nChickenpox, mumps, rubella, Epstein-Barr virus, or parvovirus can decrease your platelet count for a while. People who have AIDS often develop thrombocytopenia.\n                \nGenetic Conditions\n                \nSome genetic conditions can cause low numbers of platelets in the blood. Examples include Wiskott-Aldrich and May-Hegglin syndromes.\n                \nThe Body Destroys Its Own Platelets\n                \nA low platelet count can occur even if the bone marrow makes enough platelets. The body may destroy its own platelets due to autoimmune diseases, certain medicines, infections, surgery, pregnancy, and some conditions that cause too much blood clotting.\n                \nAutoimmune Diseases\n                \nAutoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the body. If an autoimmune disease destroys the body's platelets, thrombocytopenia can occur.\n                \nOne example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is a bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. An autoimmune response is thought to cause most cases of ITP.\n                \nNormally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. Why this happens isn't known. (ITP also may occur if the immune system attacks your bone marrow, which makes platelets.)\n                \nOther autoimmune diseases that destroy platelets include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nA reaction to medicine can confuse your body and cause it to destroy its platelets. Examples of medicines that may cause this to happen include quinine; antibiotics that contain sulfa; and some medicines for seizures, such as Dilantin, vancomycin, and rifampin. (Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.)\n                \nHeparin is a medicine commonly used to prevent blood clots. But an immune reaction may trigger the medicine to cause blood clots and thrombocytopenia. This condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT rarely occurs outside of a hospital.\n                \nIn HIT, the body's immune system attacks a substance formed by heparin and a protein on the surface of the platelets. This attack activates the platelets and they start to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots can form deep in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), or they can break loose and travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\n                \nInfection\n                \nA low platelet count can occur after blood poisoning from a widespread bacterial infection. A virus, such as mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus, also can cause a low platelet count.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nPlatelets can be destroyed when they pass through man-made heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubing used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nAbout 5 percent of pregnant women develop mild thrombocytopenia when they're close to delivery. The exact cause isn't known for sure.\n                \nRare and Serious Conditions That Cause Blood Clots\n                \nSome rare and serious conditions can cause a low platelet count. Two examples are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n                \nTTP is a rare blood condition. It causes blood clots to form in the body's small blood vessels, including vessels in the brains, kidneys, and heart.\n                \nDIC is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. Tiny blood clots form suddenly throughout the body.\n                \nIn both conditions, the blood clots use up many of the blood's platelets.\n                \nThe Spleen Holds On to Too Many Platelets\n                \nUsually, one-third of the body's platelets are held in the spleen. If the spleen is enlarged, it will hold on to too many platelets. This means that not enough platelets will circulate in the blood.\n                \nAn enlarged spleen often is due to cancer or severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver is scarred. This prevents it from working well.\n                \nAn enlarged spleen also might be due to a bone marrow condition, such as myelofibrosis (MI-eh-lo-fi-BRO-sis). With this condition, the bone marrow is scarred and isn't able to make blood cells."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Thrombocytopenia ?",
            "answer": "Mild to serious bleeding causes the main signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding).\n                \nSigns and symptoms can appear suddenly or over time. Mild thrombocytopenia often has no signs or symptoms. Many times, it's found during a routine blood test.\n                \nCheck with your doctor if you have any signs of bleeding. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause bleeding in almost any part of the body. Bleeding can lead to a medical emergency and should be treated right away.\n                \nExternal bleeding usually is the first sign of a low platelet count. External bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin.\n                \nPurpura and Petechiae\n                \n\n                \nOther signs of external bleeding include:\n                \nProlonged bleeding, even from minor cuts\n                \nBleeding or oozing from the mouth or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth\n                \nAbnormal vaginal bleeding (especially heavy menstrual flow)\n                \nA lot of bleeding after surgery or dental work also might suggest a bleeding problem.\n                \nHeavy bleeding into the intestines or the brain (internal bleeding) is serious and can be fatal. Signs and symptoms include:\n                \nBlood in the urine or stool or bleeding from the rectum. Blood in the stool can appear as red blood or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.)\n                \nHeadaches and other neurological symptoms. These problems are very rare, but you should discuss them with your doctor."

            "question": "How to diagnose Thrombocytopenia ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose thrombocytopenia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions.\n                \nOnce thrombocytopenia is diagnosed, your doctor will begin looking for its cause.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask about factors that can affect your platelets, such as:\n                \nThe medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies, and whether you drink beverages that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.\n                \nYour general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink.\n                \nYour risk for AIDS, including questions about blood transfusions, sexual partners, intravenous (IV) drugs, and exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluids at work.\n                \nAny family history of low platelet counts.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of bleeding, such as bruises or spots on the skin. He or she will check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged spleen or liver. You also will be checked for signs of infection, such as a fever.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a low platelet count. For more information about blood tests, go to the Health Topics Blood Tests article.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\n                \nIf you have thrombocytopenia, the results of this test will show that your platelet count is low.\n                \nBlood Smear\n                \nA blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in your bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nBone marrow aspiration might be done to find out why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\n                \nA bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nIf a bleeding problem is suspected, you may need other blood tests as well. For example, your doctor may recommend PT and PTT tests to see whether your blood is clotting properly.\n                \nYour doctor also may suggest an ultrasound to check your spleen. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your spleen. This will allow your doctor to see whether your spleen is enlarged."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Thrombocytopenia ?",
            "answer": "Treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on its cause and severity. The main goal of treatment is to prevent death and disability caused by bleeding.\n                \nIf your condition is mild, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count isn't necessary to prevent bleeding, even with severe cuts or accidents.\n                \nThrombocytopenia often improves when its underlying cause is treated. People who inherit the condition usually don't need treatment.\n                \nIf a reaction to a medicine is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe another medicine. Most people recover after the initial medicine has been stopped. For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), stopping the heparin isn't enough. Often, you'll need another medicine to prevent blood clotting.\n                \nIf your immune system is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress the immune system.\n                \nSevere Thrombocytopenia\n                \nIf your thrombocytopenia is severe, your doctor may prescribe treatments such as medicines, blood or platelet transfusions, or splenectomy.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, also called steroids for short. Steroids may slow platelet destruction. These medicines can be given through a vein or by mouth. One example of this type of medicine is prednisone.\n                \nThe steroids used to treat thrombocytopenia are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe immunoglobulins or medicines like rituximab to block your immune system. These medicines are given through a vein. He or she also may prescribe other medicines, such as eltrombopag or romiplostim, to help your body make more platelets. The former comes as a tablet to take by mouth and the latter is given as an injection under the skin.\n                \nBlood or Platelet Transfusions\n                \nBlood or platelet transfusions are used to treat people who have active bleeding or are at a high risk of bleeding. During this procedure, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood or platelets.\n                \nFor more information about this procedure, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nSplenectomy\n                \nA splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen. This surgery may be used if treatment with medicines doesn't work. This surgery mostly is used for adults who have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

            "question": "What is (are) Broken Heart Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Broken heart syndrome is a condition in which extreme stress can lead to heart muscle failure. The failure is severe, but often short-term.\n                \nMost people who experience broken heart syndrome think they may be having a heart attack, a more common medical emergency caused by a blocked coronary (heart) artery. The two conditions have similar symptoms, including chest pain and shortness of breath. However, theres no evidence of blocked coronary arteries in broken heart syndrome, and most people have a full and quick recovery.\n                \nOverview\n                \nBroken heart syndrome is a recently recognized heart problem. It was originally reported in the Asian population in 1990 and named takotsubo cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee). In this condition, the heart is so weak that it assumes a bulging shape (tako tsubo is the term for an octopus trap, whose shape resembles the bulging appearance of the heart during this condition). Cases have since been reported worldwide, and the first reports of broken heart syndrome in the United States appeared in 1998. The condition also is commonly called stress-induced cardiomyopathy.\n                \nThe cause of broken heart syndrome is not fully known. In most cases, symptoms are triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress, such as intense grief, anger, or surprise. Researchers think that the stress releases hormones that stun the heart and affect its ability to pump blood to the body. (The term stunned is often used to indicate that the injury to the heart muscle is only temporary.)\n                \nPeople who have broken heart syndrome often have sudden intense chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms begin just a few minutes to hours after exposure to the unexpected stress. Many seek emergency care, concerned they are having a heart attack. Often, patients who have broken heart syndrome have previously been healthy.\n                \nWomen are more likely than men to have broken heart syndrome. Researchers are just starting to explore what causes this disorder and how to diagnose and treat it.\n                \nBroken Heart Syndrome Versus Heart Attack\n                \nSymptoms of broken heart syndrome can look like those of a heart attack.\n                \nMost heart attacks are caused by blockages and blood clots forming in the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with blood. If these clots cut off the blood supply to the heart for a long enough period of time, heart muscle cells can die, leaving the heart with permanent damage. Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease.\n                \nBroken heart syndrome is quite different. Most people who experience broken heart syndrome have fairly normal coronary arteries, without severe blockages or clots. The heart cells are stunned by stress hormones but not killed. The stunning effects reverse quickly, often within just a few days or weeks. In most cases, there is no lasting damage to the heart.\n                \nBecause symptoms are similar to a heart attack, it is important to seek help right away. You, and sometimes emergency care providers, may not be able to tell that you have broken heart syndrome until you have some tests.\n                \nAll chest pain should be checked by a doctor. If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care. In the case of a heart attack, acting fast at the first sign of symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nResearch is ongoing to learn more about broken heart syndrome and its causes.\n                \nThe symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable, and most people who experience it have a full recovery, usually within days or weeks. The heart muscle is not permanently damaged, and the risk of broken heart syndrome happening again is low."

            "answer": "The cause of broken heart syndrome isnt fully known. However, extreme emotional or physical stress is believed to play a role in causing the temporary disorder.\n                \nAlthough symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack, what is happening to the heart is quite different. Most heart attacks are caused by near or complete blockage of a coronary artery. In broken heart syndrome, the coronary arteries are not blocked, although blood flow may be reduced.\n                \nPotential Triggers\n                \nIn most cases, broken heart syndrome occurs after an intense and upsetting emotional or physical event. Some potential triggers of broken heart syndrome are:\n                \nEmotional stressorsextreme grief, fear, or anger, for example as a result of the unexpected death of a loved one, financial or legal trouble, intense fear, domestic abuse, confrontational argument, car accident, public speaking, or even a surprise party.\n                \nPhysical stressorsan asthma attack, serious illness or surgery, or exhausting physical effort.\n                \nPotential Causes\n                \nResearchers think that sudden stress releases hormones that overwhelm or stun the heart. (The term stunned is often used to indicate that the injury to the heart muscle is only temporary.) This can trigger changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels, or both. The heart becomes so weak that its left ventricle (which is the chamber that pumps blood from your heart to your body) bulges and cannot pump well, while the other parts of the heart work normally or with even more forceful contractions. As a result the heart is unable to pump properly. (For more information about the hearts pumping action and blood flow, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.)\n                \nResearchers are trying to identify the precise way in which the stress hormones affect the heart. Broken heart syndrome may result from a hormone surge, coronary artery spasm, or microvascular dysfunction.\n                \nHormone Surge\n                \nIntense stress causes large amounts of the fight or flight hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, to be released into your bloodstream. The hormones are meant to help you cope with the stress. Researchers think that the sudden surge of hormones overwhelms and stuns the heart muscle, producing symptoms similar to those of a heart attack.\n                \nCoronary Artery Spasm\n                \nSome research suggests that the extreme stress causes a temporary, sudden narrowing of one of the coronary arteries as a result of a spasm. The spasm slows or stops blood flow through the artery and starves part of the heart of oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nMicrovascular Dysfunction\n                \nAnother theory that is gaining traction is that the very small coronary arteries (called microvascular arteries) do not function well due to low hormone levels occurring before or after menopause. The microvascular arteries fail to provide enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle."

Typically these symptoms begin just minutes to hours after experiencing a severe, and usually unexpected, stress.\n                \nBecause the syndrome involves severe heart muscle weakness, some people also may experience signs and symptoms such as fainting, arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs) (fast or irregular heartbeats), cardiogenic (KAR-de-o-JEN-ik) shock (when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs), low blood pressure, and heart failure.\n                \nDifferences From a Heart Attack\n                \nSome of the signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome differ from those of a heart attack. For example, in people who have broken heart syndrome:\n                \nSymptoms (chest pain and shortness of breath) occur suddenly after having extreme emotional or physical stress.\n                \nEKG(electrocardiogram) results dont look the same as the results for a person having a heart attack. (An EKG is a test that records the hearts electrical activity.)\n                \nBlood tests show no signs or mild signs of heart damage.\n                \nTests show enlarged and unusual movement of the lower left heart chamber (the left ventricle).\\\n                \nTests show no signs of blockages in the coronary arteries.\n                \nRecovery time is quick, usually within days or weeks (compared with the recovery time of a month or more for a heart attack).\n                \nComplications\n                \nBroken heart syndrome can be life threatening in some cases. It can lead to serious heart problems such as:\n                \nHeart failure, a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs\n                \nHeart rhythm problems that cause the heart to beat much faster or slower than normal\n                \nHeart valve problems\n                \nThe good news is that most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks. With medical care, even the most critically ill tend to make a quick and complete recovery."

            "question": "How to diagnose Broken Heart Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Because the symptoms are similar, at first your doctor may not be able to tell whether you are experiencing broken heart syndrome or having a heart attack. Therefore, the doctors immediate goals will be:\n                \nTo determine whats causing your symptoms\n                \nTo determine whether youre having or about to have a heart attack\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose broken heart syndrome based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nYour doctor may refer you to a cardiologist. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam and Medical History\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam and ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she may ask questions such as when your symptoms began, where you are feeling pain or discomfort and what it feels like, and whether the pain is constant or varies.\n                \nTo learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about your overall health, risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other heart disease, and family history. Your doctor will ask whether you've recently experienced any major stresses.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nNo single test can diagnose broken heart syndrome. The tests and procedures for broken heart syndrome are similar to those used to diagnose CHD or heart attack. The diagnosis is made based on the results of the following standards tests to rule out heart attack and imaging studies to help establish broken heart syndrome.\n                \nStandard Tests and Procedures\n                \n\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \n\n                \nAnEKGis a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nThe EKG may show abnormalities in your heartbeat, a sign of broken heart syndrome as well as heart damage due to CHD.\n                \n\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain substances in your blood, such as fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins. Blood tests help greatly in diagnosing broken heart syndrome, because certain enzymes (proteins in the blood) may be present in the blood to indicate the condition.\n                \nImaging Procedures\n                \n\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography(echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can show areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting well because of poor blood flow or previous injury.\n                \nThe echo may show slowed blood flow in the left chamber of the heart.\n                \n\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x rayis a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Your doctor will need a chest x ray to analyze whether your heart has the enlarged shape that is a sign of broken heart syndrome.\n                \nA chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to broken heart syndrome.\n                \n\n                \nCardiac MRI\n                \nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to make both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels. Doctors use cardiac MRI to get pictures of the beating heart and to look at its structure and function. These pictures can help them decide the best way to treat people who have heart problems.\n                \n\n                \nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\n                \nYour doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors suggest you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \n\n                \nVentriculogram\n                \nVentriculogram is another test that can be done during a cardiac catheterization that examines the left ventricle, which is the hearts main pumping chamber. During this test, a dye is injected into the inside of the heart and x ray pictures are taken. The test can show the ventricles size and how well it pumps blood. It also shows how well the blood flows through the aortic and mitral values."

            "question": "What is (are) Heart Valve Disease ?",
            "answer": "Heart valve disease occurs if one or more of your heart valves don't work well. The heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral,and aortic valves.\n                \nThese valves have tissue flaps that open and close with each heartbeat. The flaps make sure blood flows in the right direction through your heart's four chambers and to the rest of your body.\n                \nHealthy Heart Cross-Section\n                \n\n                \nBirth defects, age-related changes, infections, or other conditions can cause one or more of your heart valves to not open fully or to let blood leak back into the heart chambers. This can make your heart work harder and affect its ability to pump blood.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHow the Heart Valves Work\n                \nAt the start of each heartbeat, blood returning from the body and lungs fills the atria (the heart's two upper chambers). The mitral and tricuspid valves are located at the bottom of these chambers. As the blood builds up in the atria, these valves open to allow blood to flow into the ventricles (the heart's two lower chambers).\n                \nAfter a brief delay, as the ventricles begin to contract, the mitral and tricuspid valves shut tightly. This prevents blood from flowing back into the atria.\n                \nAs the ventricles contract, they pump blood through the pulmonary and aortic valves. The pulmonary valve opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. This artery carries blood to the lungs to get oxygen.\n                \nAt the same time, the aortic valve opens to allow blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body. As the ventricles relax, the pulmonary and aortic valves shut tightly. This prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles.\n                \nFor more information about how the heart pumps blood and detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.\n                \nHeart Valve Problems\n                \nHeart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: regurgitation, stenosis, and atresia.\n                \nRegurgitation, or backflow, occurs if a valve doesn't close tightly. Blood leaks back into the chambers rather than flowing forward through the heart or into an artery.\n                \nIn the United States, backflow most often is due to prolapse. \"Prolapse\" is when the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back into an upper heart chamber during a heartbeat. Prolapse mainly affects the mitral valve.\n                \nStenosis occurs if the flaps of a valve thicken, stiffen, or fuse together. This prevents the heart valve from fully opening. As a result, not enough blood flows through the valve. Some valves can have both stenosis and backflow problems.\n                \nAtresia occurs if a heart valve lacks an opening for blood to pass through.\n                \nSome people are born with heart valve disease, while others acquire it later in life. Heart valve disease that develops before birth is called congenitalheart valve disease. Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other congenital heart defects.\n                \nCongenital heart valve disease often involves pulmonary or aortic valves that don't form properly. These valves may not have enough tissue flaps, they may be the wrong size or shape, or they may lack an opening through which blood can flow properly.\n                \nAcquired heart valve disease usually involves aortic or mitral valves. Although the valves are normal at first, problems develop over time.\n                \nBoth congenital and acquired heart valve disease can cause stenosis or backflow.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMany people have heart valve defects or disease but don't have symptoms. For some people, the condition mostly stays the same throughout their lives and doesn't cause any problems.\n                \nFor other people, heart valve disease slowly worsens until symptoms develop. If not treated, advanced heart valve disease can cause heart failure, stroke, blood clots, or death due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).\n                \nCurrently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines can relieve many of its symptoms and complications. \n                \nThese treatments also can lower your risk of developing a life-threatening condition, such as stroke or SCA. Eventually, you may need to have your faulty heart valve repaired or replaced.\n                \nSome types of congenital heart valve disease are so severe that the valve is repaired or replaced during infancy, childhood, or even before birth. Other types may not cause problems until middle-age or older, if at all."

            "question": "What causes Heart Valve Disease ?",
            "answer": "Heart conditions and other disorders, age-related changes, rheumatic fever, or infections can cause acquired heart valve disease. These factors change the shape or flexibility of once-normal heart valves.\n                \nThe cause of congenital heart valve disease isnt known. It occurs before birth as the heart is forming. Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other types of congenital heartdefects.\n                \nHeart Conditions and Other Disorders\n                \nCertain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves. These conditions include:\n                \nAdvanced high blood pressure and heart failure, thiscan enlarge the heart or the main arteries.\n                \nAtherosclerosis in the aorta. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n                \nDamage and scar tissue due to a heart attack or injury to the heart.\n                \nRheumatic Fever\n                \nUntreated strep throat or other infections with strep bacteria that progress to rheumatic fever can cause heart valve disease.\n                \nWhen the body tries to fight the strep infection, one or more heart valves may be damaged or scarred in the process. The aortic and mitral valves most often are affected. Symptoms of heart valve damage often dont appear until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever.\n                \nToday, most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever occurs. If you have strep throat, take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes, even if you feel better before the medicine is gone.\n                \nHeart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever mainly affects older adults who had strep infections before antibiotics were available. It also affects people from developing countries, where rheumatic fever is more common.\n                \nInfections\n                \nCommon germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart, including the heart valves. This rare but serious infection is called infective endocarditis.\n                \nThe germs can enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices and through breaks in the skin or gums. Often, the bodys defenses fight off the germs and no infection occurs. Sometimes these defenses fail, which leads to infective endocarditis.\n                \nInfective endocarditis can develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve as the result of congenital or acquired heart valve disease. The abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve. The blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve.\n                \nInfective endocarditis can worsen existing heart valve disease.\n                \nOther Conditions and Factors Linked to Heart Valve Disease\n                \nMany other conditions and factors are linked to heart valve disease. However, the role they play in causing heart valve disease often isnt clear.\n                \nAutoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, can affect the aortic and mitral valves.\n                \nCarcinoid syndrome. Tumors in the digestive tract that spread to the liver or lymph nodes can affect the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.\n                \nDiet medicines. The use of fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen) sometimes has been linked to heart valve problems. These problems typically stabilize or improve after the medicine is stopped.\n                \nMarfan syndrome. Congenital disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders, can affect the heart valves.\n                \nMetabolic disorders. Relatively uncommon diseases (such as Fabry disease) and other metabolic disorders (such as high blood cholesterol) can affect the heart valves.\n                \nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy to the chest area can cause heart valve disease. This therapy is used to treat cancer. Heart valve disease due to radiation therapy may not cause symptoms until years after the therapy."

            "answer": "Older age is a risk factor for heart valve disease. As you age, your heart valves thicken and become stiffer. Also, people are living longer now than in the past. As a result, heart valve disease has become an increasing problem.\n                \nPeople who have a history of infective endocarditis (IE), rheumatic fever, heart attack, or heart failureor previous heart valve diseasealso are at higher risk for heart valve disease. In addition, having risk factors for IE, such as intravenous drug use, increases the risk of heart valve disease.\n                \nYou're also at higher risk for heart valve disease if you have risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, and a family history of early heart disease.\n                \nSome people are born with an aortic valve that has two flaps instead of three. Sometimes an aortic valve may have three flaps, but two flaps are fused together and act as one flap. This is called a bicuspid or bicommissural aortic valve. People who have this congenital condition are more likely to develop aortic heart valve disease."

Echoes from the sound waves are converted into pictures of your heart on a computer screen.\n                \nEcho can show:\n                \nThe size and shape of your heart valves and chambers\n                \nHow well your heart is pumping blood\n                \nWhether a valve is narrow or has backflow\n                \nYour doctor may recommend transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, to get a better image of your heart.\n                \nDuring TEE, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). From there, your doctor can get detailed pictures of your heart.\n                \nYou'll likely be given medicine to help you relax during this procedure.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nFor this procedure, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. Your doctor uses x-ray images to guide the catheter.\n                \nThrough the catheter, your doctor does diagnostic tests and imaging that show whether backflow is occurring through a valve and how fully the valve opens. You'll be given medicine to help you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend cardiac catheterization if your signs and symptoms of heart valve disease aren't in line with your echo results.\n                \nThe procedure also can help your doctor assess whether your symptoms are due to specific valve problems or coronary heart disease. All of this information helps your doctor decide the best way to treat you.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests and imaging are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nA stress test can show whether you have signs and symptoms of heart valve disease when your heart is working hard. It can help your doctor assess the severity of your heart valve disease.\n                \nCardiac MRI\n                \nCardiac MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to make detailed images of your heart. A cardiac MRI image can confirm information about valve defects or provide more detailed information.\n                \nThis information can help your doctor plan your treatment. An MRI also may be done before heart valve surgery to help your surgeon plan for the surgery."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Valve Disease ?",
            "answer": "Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines often can treat symptoms successfully and delay problems for many years. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.\n                \nThe goals of treating heart valve disease might include:\n                \nMedicines\n                \nRepairing or replacing faulty valves\n                \nLifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIn addition to heart-healthy lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nLower high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol.\n                \nPrevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\n                \nThin the blood and prevent clots (if you have a man-made replacement valve). Doctors also prescribe these medicines for mitral stenosis or other valve defects that raise the risk of blood clots.\n                \nTreat coronary heart disease. Medicines for coronary heart disease can reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms.\n                \nTreatheart failure. Heart failure medicines widen blood vessels and rid the body of excess fluid.\n                \nRepairing or Replacing Heart Valves\n                \nYour doctor may recommend repairing or replacing your heart valve(s), even if your heart valve disease isnt causing symptoms. Repairing or replacing a valve can prevent lasting damage to your heart and sudden death.\n                \nThe decision to repair or replace heart valves depends on many factors, including:\n                \nThe severity of your valve disease\n                \nWhether you need heart surgery for other conditions, such as bypass surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Bypass surgery and valve surgery can be performed at the sametime.\n                \nYour age and general health\n                \nWhen possible, heart valve repair is preferred over heart valve replacement. Valve repair preserves the strength and function of the heart muscle. People who have valve repair also have a lower risk of infective endocarditis after the surgery, and they dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.\n                \nHowever, heart valve repair surgery is harder to do than valve replacement. Also, not all valves can be repaired. Mitral valves often can be repaired. Aortic and pulmonary valves often have to be replaced.\n                \nRepairing Heart Valves\n                \nHeart surgeons can repair heart valves by:\n                \nAdding tissue to patch holes or tears or to increase the support at the base of the valve\n                \nRemoving or reshaping tissue so the valve can close tighter\n                \nSeparating fused valve flaps\n                \nSometimes cardiologists repair heart valves using cardiac catheterization. Although catheter procedures are less invasive than surgery, they may not work as well for some patients. Work with your doctor to decide whether repair is appropriate. If so, your doctor can advise you on the best procedure.\n                \nHeart valves that cannot open fully (stenosis) can be repaired with surgery or with a less invasive catheter procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. This procedure also is called balloonvalvotomy.\n                \nDuring the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at its tip is threaded through a blood vessel to the faulty valve in your heart. The balloon is inflated to help widen the opening of the valve. Your doctor then deflates the balloon and removes both it and the tube. Youre awake during the procedure, which usually requires an overnight stay in a hospital.\n                \nBalloon valvuloplasty relieves many symptoms of heart valve disease, but may not cure it. The condition can worsen over time. You still may need medicines to treat symptoms or surgery to repair or replace the faulty valve. Balloon valvuloplasty has a shorter recovery time than surgery. The procedure may work as well as surgery for some patients who have mitral valve stenosis. For these people, balloon valvuloplasty often is preferred over surgical repair or replacement.\n                \nBalloon valvuloplasty doesnt work as well as surgery for adults who have aortic valve stenosis. Doctors often use balloon valvuloplasty to repair valve stenosis in infants and children.\n                \nReplacing Heart Valves\n                \nSometimes heart valves cant be repaired and must be replaced. This surgery involves removing the faulty valve and replacing it with a man-made or biological valve.\n                \nBiological valves are made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue and may have man-made parts as well. These valves are specially treated, so you wont need medicines to stop your body from rejecting the valve.\n                \nMan-made valves last longer than biological valves and usually dont have to be replaced. Biological valves usually have to be replaced after about 10 years, although newer ones may last 15years or longer. Unlike biological valves, however, man-made valves require you to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of your life. These medicines prevent blood clots from forming on the valve. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. Man-made valves also raise your risk of infective endocarditis.\n                \nYou and your doctor will decide together whether you should have a man-made or biological replacement valve.\n                \nIf youre a woman of childbearing age or if youre athletic, you may prefer a biological valve so you dont have to take blood-thinning medicines. If youre elderly, you also may prefer a biological valve, as it will likely last for the rest of your life.\n                \nRoss Procedure\n                \nDoctors also can treat faulty aortic valves with the Ross procedure. During this surgery, your doctor removes your faulty aortic valve and replaces it with your pulmonary valve. Your pulmonary valve is then replaced with a pulmonary valve from a deceased humandonor.\n                \nThis is more involved surgery than typical valve replacement, and it has a greater risk of complications. The Ross procedure may be especially useful for children because the surgically replaced valves continue to grow with the child. Also, lifelong treatment with blood-thinning medicines isnt required. But in some patients, one or both valves fail to work well within a few years of the surgery. Researchers continue to study the use of this procedure.\n                \nOther Approaches for Repairing and Replacing Heart Valves\n                \nSome forms of heart valve repair and replacement surgery are less invasive than traditional surgery. These procedures use smaller incisions (cuts) to reach the heart valves. Hospital stays for these newer types of surgery usually are 3 to 5 days, compared with a 5-day stay for traditional heart valve surgery.\n                \nNew surgeries tend to cause less pain and have a lower risk of infection. Recovery time also tends to be shorter2to 4weeks versus 6to 8weeks for traditional surgery.\n                \nTranscatheter Valve Therapy\n                \nInterventional cardiologists perform procedures that involve threading clips or other devices to repair faulty heart valves using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. The clips or devices are used to reshape the valves and stop the backflow of blood. People who receive these clips recover more easily than people who have surgery. However, the clips may not treat backflow as well as surgery.\n                \nDoctors also may use a catheter to replace faulty aortic valves. This procedure is called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For this procedure, the catheter usually is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the heart. A deflated balloon with a folded replacement valve around it is at the end of the catheter.\n                \nOnce the replacement valve is placed properly, the balloon is used to expand the new valve so it fits securely within the old valve. The balloon is then deflated, and the balloon and catheter are removed.\n                \nA replacement valve also can be inserted in an existing replacement valve that is failing. This is called a valve-in-valve procedure.\n                \nLifestyle Changes to Treat Other Related Heart\n                \nTo help treat heart conditions related to heart valve disease, your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nAvocadosNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart valve disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many heart valve disease risk factors.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis and other health problems. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic."

            "answer": "To prevent heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever, see your doctor if you have signs of a strep infection. These signs include a painful sore throat, fever, and white spots on your tonsils. If you do have a strep infection, be sure to take all medicines prescribed to treat it. Prompt treatment of strep infections can prevent rheumatic fever, which damages the heartvalves.\n                \nIts possible that exercise, a heart-healthy diet, and medicines that lower cholesterol might prevent aortic stenosis (thickening and stiffening of the aortic valve). Researchers continue to study this possibility.\n                \nHeart-healthy eating, physical activity, other heart-healthy lifestyle changes, and medicines aimed at preventing a heart attack, high blood pressure, or heart failure also may help prevent heart valve disease."

            "question": "What is (are) Polycythemia Vera ?",
            "answer": "Polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THEE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah), or PV, is a rare blood disease in which your body makes too many red blood cells.\n                \nThe extra red blood cells make your blood thicker than normal. As a result, blood clots can form more easily. These clots can block blood flow through your arteries and veins, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nThicker blood also doesn't flow as quickly to your body as normal blood. Slowed blood flow prevents your organs from getting enough oxygen, which can cause serious problems, such as angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) and heart failure. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)\n                \nOverview\n                \nRed blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.\n                \nRed blood cells are made in your bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in your bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nIf you have PV, your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It also can make too many white blood cells and platelets.\n                \nA mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV. This gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells. What causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nPV develops slowly and may not cause symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons.\n                \nWhen signs and symptoms are present, they're the result of the thick blood that occurs with PV. This thickness slows the flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally.\n                \nFor example, slower blood flow deprives your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes of the oxygen they need. This can cause headaches, dizziness, itching, and vision problems, such as blurred or double vision.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPV is a serious, chronic (ongoing) disease that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. PV has no cure, but treatments can help control the disease and its complications.\n                \nPV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease."

Other, unknown genetic factors also may play a role in causing PV.\n                \nSecondary Polycythemia\n                \nAnother type of polycythemia, called secondary polycythemia, isn't related to the JAK2 gene. Long-term exposure to low oxygen levels causes secondary polycythemia.\n                \nA lack of oxygen over a long period can cause your body to make more of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). High levels of EPO can prompt your body to make more red blood cells than normal. This leads to thicker blood, as seen in PV.\n                \nPeople who have severe heart or lung disease may develop secondary polycythemia. People who smoke, spend long hours at high altitudes, or are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide where they work or live also are at risk.\n                \nFor example, working in an underground parking garage or living in a home with a poorly vented fireplace or furnace can raise your risk for secondary polycythemia.\n                \nRarely, tumors can make and release EPO, or certain blood problems can cause the body to make more EPO.\n                \nSometimes doctors can cure secondary polycythemiait depends on whether the underlying cause can be stopped, controlled, or cured."

Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of PV include:\n                \nHeadaches, dizziness, and weakness\n                \nShortness of breath and problems breathing while lying down\n                \nFeelings of pressure or fullness on the left side of the abdomen due to an enlarged spleen (an organ in the abdomen)\n                \nDouble or blurred vision and blind spots\n                \nItching all over (especially after a warm bath), reddened face, and a burning feeling on your skin (especially your hands and feet)\n                \nBleeding from your gums and heavy bleeding from small cuts\n                \nUnexplained weight loss\n                \nFatigue (tiredness)\n                \nExcessive sweating\n                \nVery painful swelling in a single joint, usually the big toe (called gouty arthritis)\n                \nIn rare cases, people who have PV may have pain in their bones.\n                \nPolycythemia Vera Complications\n                \nIf you have PV, the thickness of your blood and the slowed blood flow can cause serious health problems.\n                \nBlood clots are the most serious complication of PV. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. They also can cause your liver and spleen to enlarge. Blood clots in the liver and spleen can cause sudden, intense pain.\n                \nSlowed blood flow also prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your organs. This can lead to angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure. The high levels of red blood cells that PV causes can lead to stomach ulcers, gout, or kidney stones.\n                \nSome people who have PV may develop myelofibrosis (MY-e-lo-fi-BRO-sis). This is a condition in which your bone marrow is replaced with scar tissue. Abnormal bone marrow cells may begin to grow out of control.\n                \nThis abnormal growth can lead to acute myelogenous (my-eh-LOJ-eh-nus) leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This disease can worsen very quickly."

            "question": "How to diagnose Polycythemia Vera ?",
            "answer": "Polycythemia vera (PV) may not cause signs or symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons. If the results of your blood tests aren't normal, your doctor may want to do more tests.\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose PV based on your signs and symptoms, your age and overall health, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of PV. He or she will check for an enlarged spleen, red skin on your face, and bleeding from your gums.\n                \nIf your doctor confirms that you have polycythemia, the next step is to find out whether you have primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) or secondary polycythemia.\n                \nYour medical history and physical exam may confirm which type of polycythemia you have. If not, you may have tests that check the level of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in your blood.\n                \nPeople who have PV have very low levels of EPO. People who have secondary polycythemia usually have normal or high levels of EPO.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf your primary care doctor thinks you have PV, he or she may refer you to a hematologist. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have blood tests to diagnose PV. These tests include a complete blood count (CBC) and other tests, if necessary.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nOften, the first test used to diagnose PV is a CBC. The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\n                \nThis test checks your hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A high level of hemoglobin or hematocrit may be a sign of PV.\n                \nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of PV, a blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\n                \nIn addition to high red blood cell counts, people who have PV also may have high white blood cell and/or platelet counts.\n                \nOther Blood Tests\n                \nBlood smear. For this test, a small sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood sample is examined under a microscope.\n                \nA blood smear can show whether you have a higher than normal number of red blood cells. The test also can show abnormal blood cells that are linked to myelofibrosis and other conditions related to PV.\n                \nErythropoietin level. This blood test measures the level of EPO in your blood. EPO is a hormone that prompts your bone marrow to make new blood cells. People who have PV have very low levels of EPO. People who have secondary polycythemia usually have normal or high levels of EPO.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is healthy. These tests also show whether your bone marrow is making normal amounts of blood cells.\n                \nThe two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. For aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. For a biopsy, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle. The samples are then examined under a microscope.\n                \nIf the tests show that your bone marrow is making too many blood cells, it may be a sign that you have PV."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Polycythemia Vera ?",
            "answer": "Polycythemia vera (PV) doesn't have a cure. However, treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nThe goals of treating PV are to control symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, especially heart attack and stroke. To do this, PV treatments reduce the number of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin (an iron-rich protein) in the blood. This brings the thickness of your blood closer to normal.\n                \nBlood with normal thickness flows better through the blood vessels. This reduces the chance that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nBlood with normal thickness also ensures that your body gets enough oxygen. This can help reduce some of the signs and symptoms of PV, such as headaches, vision problems, and itching.\n                \nStudies show that treating PV greatly improves your chances of living longer.\n                \nThe goal of treating secondary polycythemia is to control its underlying cause, if possible. For example, if the cause is carbon monoxide exposure, the goal is to find the source of the carbon monoxide and fix or remove it.\n                \nTreatments To Lower Red Blood Cell Levels\n                \nPhlebotomy\n                \nPhlebotomy (fle-BOT-o-me) is a procedure that removes some blood from your body. For this procedure, a needle is inserted into one of your veins. Blood from the vein flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to the process of donating blood.\n                \nPhlebotomy reduces your red blood cell count and starts to bring your blood thickness closer to normal.\n                \nTypically, a pint (1 unit) of blood is removed each week until your hematocrit level approaches normal. (Hematocrit is the measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.)\n                \nYou may need to have phlebotomy done every few months.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells. Examples of these medicines include hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha.\n                \nHydroxyurea is a medicine generally used to treat cancer. This medicine can reduce the number of red blood cells and platelets in your blood. As a result, this medicine helps improve your blood flow and bring the thickness of your blood closer to normal.\n                \nInterferon-alpha is a substance that your body normally makes. It also can be used to treat PV. Interferon-alpha can prompt your immune system to fight overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.\n                \nRadiation Treatment\n                \nRadiation treatment can help suppress overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.\n                \nHowever, radiation treatment can raise your risk of leukemia (blood cancer) and other blood diseases.\n                \nTreatments for Symptoms\n                \nAspirin can relieve bone pain and burning feelings in your hands or feet that you may have as a result of PV. Aspirin also thins your blood, so it reduces the risk of blood clots.\n                \nAspirin can have side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. For this reason, take aspirin only as your doctor recommends.\n                \nIf your PV causes itching, your doctor may prescribe medicines to ease the discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe ultraviolet light treatment to help relieve your itching.\n                \nOther ways to reduce itching include:\n                \nAvoiding hot baths. Cooler water can limit irritation to your skin.\n                \nGently patting yourself dry after bathing. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can irritate your skin.\n                \nTaking starch baths. Add half a box of starch to a tub of lukewarm water. This can help soothe your skin.\n                \nExperimental Treatments\n                \nResearchers are studying other treatments for PV. An experimental treatment for itching involves taking low doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is used to treat depression. In clinical trials, SSRIs reduced itching in people who had PV.\n                \nImatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia. In clinical trials, this medicine helped reduce the need for phlebotomy in people who had PV. This medicine also helped reduce the size of enlarged spleens.\n                \nResearchers also are trying to find a treatment that can block or limit the effects of an abnormal JAK2 gene. (A mutation, or change, in the JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV.)"

            "question": "What is (are) Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).\n                \nOHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nSmall blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange.\n                \nIn people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops.\n                \nThese changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal.\n                \nThe cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder.\n                \nMany people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nObstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.)\n                \nOutlook\n                \nDoctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep.\n                \nPAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure).\n                \nIf your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs.\n                \nOther treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.)\n                \nOHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active.\n                \nOHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment."

People who are obese have body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nThe most useful measure of obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight.

You're also at greater risk if most of your excess weight is around your waist, rather than at your hips. This is referred to as \"abdominal obesity.\"\n                \nOHS tends to occur more often in men than women. At the time of diagnosis, most people are 40 to 60 years old."

The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured.\n                \nOther tests also can measure the carbon dioxide level or oxygen level in your blood. These tests include a serum bicarbonate test and pulse oximetry.\n                \nA serum bicarbonate test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid part of your blood, called the serum. For this test, a blood sample is taken from a vein, usually in your wrist or hand.\n                \nPulse oximetry measures the level of oxygen in your blood.

Straps keep the mask in place while you're wearing it.\n                \nA tube that connects the mask to the machine's motor.\n                \nA motor that blows air into the tube.\n                \nSome machines have other features, such as heated humidifiers. The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic.\n                \nSome people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn't recommended as a treatment for OHS.\n                \nPAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition.\n                \nIf your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you pick a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs.\n                \nVentilator Support\n                \nIf you have severe OHS that requires treatment in a hospital, you might be put on a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. This machine:\n                \nGets oxygen into your lungs\n                \nRemoves carbon dioxide from your body\n                \nHelps you breathe easier\n                \nA ventilator blows air, or air with extra oxygen, into the airways through a breathing tube. One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator.\n                \nUsually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting.\n                \nSometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe.\n                \nThe procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You'll be given medicine so you won't feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about how long you'll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home.\n                \nFor more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics Ventilator/Ventilator Support article.\n                \nWeight Loss\n                \nYour doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight.\n                \nMedicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Your doctor will advise you on the best weight-loss treatment for you.\n                \nFor more information about weight loss, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to treat OHS (although this treatment is less common than others).\n                \nYour doctor also may advise you to avoid certain substances and medicines that can worsen OHS. Examples include alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. They can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.\n                \nIf you're having surgery, make sure you tell your surgeon and health care team that you have OHS. Some medicines routinely used for surgery can worsen your condition."

            "question": "How to prevent Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "You can prevent obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) by maintaining a healthy weight. However, not everyone who is obese develops OHS. Researchers don't fully know why only some people who are obese develop the condition.\n                \nAdopting healthy habits can help you maintain a healthy weight. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. So, it's important to make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal.\n                \nA healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, eggs, poultry without skin, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). Examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread.\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nTo adopt other healthy lifestyle habits, follow these tips:\n                \nFocus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion sizes will help you manage your calorie intake.\n                \nBe physically active. Make personal and family time as active as possible. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run.\n                \nReduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames; they cut back on the time for physical activity. Health experts recommend2 hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related.\n                \nKeep track of your weight and body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nFor more information, go to the prevention section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nEven if you have OHS, you might be able to prevent the condition from worsening. For example, avoid alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. These substances can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels."

            "question": "What is (are) Carotid Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Carotid artery disease is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the carotid arteries. You have two common carotid arteries, one on each side of your neck. They each divide into internal and external carotid arteries.\n                \nThe internal carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. The external carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your face, scalp, and neck.\n                \nCarotid Arteries\n                \n\n                \nCarotid artery disease is serious because it can cause a stroke, also called a brain attack. A stroke occurs if blood flow to your brain is cut off.\n                \nIf blood flow is cut off for more than a few minutes, the cells in your brain start to die. This impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nCarotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the United States. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This may limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.\n                \nAtherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body. For example, if plaque builds up in the coronary (heart) arteries, a heart attack can occur. If plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, a stroke can occur.\n                \nA stroke also can occur if blood clots form in the carotid arteries. This can happen if the plaque in an artery cracks or ruptures. Blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. Blood clots can partly or fully block a carotid artery.\n                \nA piece of plaque or a blood clot also can break away from the wall of the carotid artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brain's smaller arteries. This can block blood flow in the artery and cause a stroke.\n                \nCarotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until the carotid arteries are severely narrowed or blocked. For some people, a stroke is the first sign of the disease.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nCarotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the United States. Other conditions, such as certain heart problems and bleeding in the brain, also can cause strokes.Lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat carotid artery disease and may reduce the risk of stroke.\n                \nIf you think you're having a stroke, you need urgent treatment. Call 911 right away if you have symptoms of a stroke. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.You have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. The sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery."

            "question": "What causes Carotid Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Carotid artery disease seems to start when damage occurs to the inner layers of the carotid arteries. Major factors that contribute to damage include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh levels of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh levels of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nWhen damage occurs, your body starts a healing process. The healing may cause plaque to build up where the arteries are damaged.\n                \nThe plaque in an artery can crack or rupture. If this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets will stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. \n                \nThe buildup of plaque or blood clots can severely narrow or block the carotid arteries.

            "question": "Who is at risk for Carotid Artery Disease? ?",
            "answer": "The major risk factors for carotid artery disease, listed below, also are the major risk factors for coronary heart disease (also called coronary artery disease) and peripheral artery disease.\n                \nDiabetes. With this disease, the bodys blood sugar level is too high because the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. People who have diabetes are four times more likely to have carotid artery disease than are people who dont have diabetes.\n                \nFamily history of atherosclerosis. People who have a family history of atherosclerosis are more likely to develop carotid artery disease.\n                \nHigh blood pressure (Hypertension). Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nLack of physical activity.Too much sitting (sedentary lifestyle) and a lack of aerobic activity can worsen other risk factors for carotid artery disease, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for stroke and other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. The five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level (a type of fat found in the blood), a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.\n                \nOlder age. As you age, your risk for atherosclerosis increases. The process of atherosclerosis begins in youth and typically progresses over many decades before diseases develop.\n                \nOverweight or obesity. The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the bodys tissues.\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL (bad) cholesterol) and low HDL (good) cholesterol.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for carotid artery disease. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can worsen other risk factors for carotid artery disease.\n                \nHaving any of these risk factors does not guarantee that youll develop carotid artery disease. However, if you know that you have one or more risk factors, you can take steps to help prevent or delay the disease.\n                \nIf you have plaque buildup in your carotid arteries, you also may have plaque buildup in other arteries. People who have carotid artery disease also are at increased risk for coronary heartdisease."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Carotid Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until it severely narrows or blocks a carotid artery. Signs and symptoms may include a bruit, a transient ischemic attack(TIA), or a stroke.\n                \nBruit\n                \nDuring a physical exam, your doctor may listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. He or she may hear a whooshing sound called a bruit. This sound may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup. To find out more, your doctor may recommend tests.\n                \nNot all people who have carotid artery disease have bruits.\n                \nTransient Ischemic Attack (Mini-Stroke)\n                \nFor some people, having a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, is the first sign of carotid artery disease. During a mini-stroke, you may have some or all of the symptoms of a stroke. However, the symptoms usually go away on their own within 24 hours.\n                \nStroke and mini-stroke symptoms may include:\n                \nA sudden, severe headache with no known cause\n                \nDizziness or loss of balance\n                \nInability to move one or more of your limbs\n                \nSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\n                \nSudden weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, often on just one side of the body\n                \nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\n                \nEven if the symptoms stop quickly, call 911 for emergency help. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Its important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible.\n                \nA mini-stroke is a warning sign that youre at high risk of having a stroke. You shouldnt ignore these symptoms. Getting medical care can help find possible causes of a mini-stroke and help you manage risk factors. These actions might prevent a future stroke.\n                \nAlthough a mini-stroke may warn of a stroke, it doesnt predict when a stroke will happen. A stroke may occur days, weeks, or even months after a mini-stroke.\n                \nStroke\n                \nThe symptoms of a stroke are the same as those of a mini-stroke, but the results are not. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death. Most people who have strokes have not previously had warning mini-strokes.\n                \nGetting treatment for a stroke right away is very important. You have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. The sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery.\n                \nCall 911 for emergency help as soon as symptoms occur. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Its very important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible.\n                \nMake those close to you aware of stroke symptoms and the need for urgent action. Learning the signs and symptoms of a stroke will allow you to help yourself or someone close to you lower the risk of brain damage or death due to a stroke."

If you have symptoms of a mini-stroke or stroke, your doctor may use other tests as well.\n                \nCarotid Ultrasound\n                \nCarotid ultrasound (also called sonography) is the most common test for diagnosing carotid artery disease. It's a painless, harmless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries. This test can show whether plaque has narrowed your carotid arteries and how narrow they are.\n                \nA standard carotid ultrasound shows the structure of your carotid arteries. A Doppler carotid ultrasound shows how blood moves through your carotid arteries.\n                \nCarotid Angiography\n                \nCarotid angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a special type of x ray. This test may be used if the ultrasound results are unclear or don't give your doctor enough information.\n                \nFor this test, your doctor will inject a substance (called contrast dye) into a vein, most often in your leg. The dye travels to your carotid arteries and highlights them on x-ray pictures.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Angiography\n                \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses a large magnet and radio waves to take pictures of your carotid arteries. Your doctor can see these pictures on a computer screen.\n                \nFor this test, your doctor may give you contrast dye to highlight your carotid arteries on the pictures.\n                \nComputed Tomography Angiography\n                \nComputed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) angiography, or CT angiography, takes x-ray pictures of the body from many angles.

This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for carotid artery disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nManaging and coping with stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication. This type of medication must be given within 4 hours of symptom onset. The sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery. If you think youre having a stroke, call 911 right away for emergency care.\n                \nMedicines to prevent blood clots are the mainstay treatment for people who have carotid artery disease. They prevent platelets from clumping together and forming blood clots in your carotid arteries, which can lead to a stroke. Two common medications are:\n                \nAspirin\n                \nClopidogrel\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHeart disease or have had a stroke\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\n                \nYou may need other medications to treat diseases and conditions that damage the carotid arteries. Your doctor also may prescribe medications to:\n                \nLower your blood pressure.\n                \nLower your blood sugar level.\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming, which can lead to stroke.\n                \nPrevent or reduce inflammation.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. Your health care team will help find a treatment plan thats right for you.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nYou may need a medical procedure if you have symptoms caused by the narrowing of the carotid artery. Doctors use one of two methods to open narrowed or blocked carotid arteries: carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery angioplasty and stenting.\n                \nCarotid Endarterectomy\n                \nCarotid endarterectomy is mainly for people whose carotid arteries are blocked 50percent ormore.\n                \nFor the procedure, a surgeon will make a cut in your neck to reach the narrowed or blocked carotid artery. Next, he or she will make a cut in the blocked part of the artery and remove the arterys inner lining that is blocking the blood flow.\n                \nFinally, your surgeon will close the artery with stitches and stop any bleeding. He or she will then close the cut in your neck.\n                \nCarotid Endarterectomy\n                \n\n                \nCarotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting\n                \nDoctors use a procedure called angioplasty to widen the carotid arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.\n                \nA thin tube with a deflated balloon on the end is threaded through a blood vessel in your neck to the narrowed or blocked carotid artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery.\n                \nA stent (a small mesh tube) is then put in the artery to support the inner artery wall. The stent also helps prevent the artery from becoming narrowed or blocked again.\n                \nCarotid Artery Stenting"

            "question": "What is (are) Cough ?",
            "answer": "A cough is a natural reflex that protects your lungs. Coughing helps clear your airways of lung irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). This helps prevent infections. A cough also can be a symptom of a medical problem.\n                \nProlonged coughing can cause unpleasant side effects, such as chest pain, exhaustion, light-headedness, and loss of bladder control. Coughing also can interfere with sleep, socializing, and work.\n                \nOverview\n                \nCoughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. Certain substances (such as smoke and pollen), medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings.\n                \nA cough can be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on how long it lasts.\n                \nAn acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory (RES-pi-rah-tor-e) infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah), and whooping cough.\n                \nA subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over.\n                \nA chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS); asthma; and gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease, or GERD.\n                \n\"UACS\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip.\n                \nAsthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. For example, asthma is treated with medicines that open the airways.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend cough medicine if the cause of your cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Cough medicines may harm children. If your child has a cough, talk with his or her doctor about how to treat it."

Certain irritants and allergens, medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings.\n                \nIrritants and Allergens\n                \nAn irritant is something you're sensitive to. For example, smoking or inhaling secondhand smoke can irritate your lungs. Smoking also can lead to medical conditions that can cause a cough. Other irritants include air pollution, paint fumes, or scented products like perfumes or air fresheners.\n                \nAn allergen is something you're allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, mold, or pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers.\n                \nCoughing helps clear your airways of irritants and allergens. This helps prevent infections.\n                \nMedical Conditions\n                \nMany medical conditions can cause acute, subacute, or chronic cough.\n                \nCommon causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks.\n                \nA lingering cough that remains after a cold or other respiratory infection is gone often is called a subacute cough. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks.\n                \nCommon causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

A cough from an upper respiratory infection can develop into a chronic cough.\n                \nChronic bronchitis (bron-KI-tis). This condition occurs if the lining of the airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.\n                \nBronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-tah-sis). This is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred. This prevents the airways from properly moving mucus out of your lungs. An infection or other condition that injures the walls of the airways usually causes bronchiectasis.\n                \nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a disease that prevents enough air from flowing in and out of the airways.\n                \nLung cancer. In rare cases, a chronic cough is due to lung cancer. Most people who develop lung cancer smoke or used to smoke.\n                \nHeart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Fluid can build up in the body and lead to many symptoms. If fluid builds up in the lungs, it can cause a chronic cough.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nCertain medicines can cause a chronic cough. Examples of these medicines are ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure (HBP). Beta blockers are used to treat HBP, migraine headaches, and glaucoma."

He or she will listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests based on the results of your medical history and physical exam. For example, if you have symptoms of GERD, your doctor may recommend a pH probe. This test measures the acid level of the fluid in your throat.\n                \nOther tests may include:\n                \nAn exam of the mucus from your nose or throat. This test can show whether you have a bacterial infection.\n                \nA chest x ray. A chest x ray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. This test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer.\n                \nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.

The lungs are one of the main organs that the AAT protein protects.\n                \nAAT deficiency occurs if the AAT proteins made in the liver aren't the right shape. They get stuck inside liver cells and can't get into the bloodstream.\n                \nAs a result, not enough AAT proteins travel to the lungs to protect them. This increases the risk of lung disease. Also, because too many AAT proteins are stuck in the liver, liver disease can develop.\n                \nSevere AAT deficiency occurs if blood levels of the AAT protein fall below the lowest amount needed to protect the lungs.\n                \nAAT deficiency is an inherited condition. \"Inherited\" means it's passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nDoctors don't know how many people have AAT deficiency. Many people who have the condition may not know they have it. Estimates of how many people have AAT deficiency range from about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPeople who have AAT deficiency may not have serious complications, and they may live close to a normal lifespan.\n                \nAmong people with AAT deficiency who have a related lung or liver disease, about 3percent die each year.\n                \nSmoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease if you have AAT deficiency. Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of earlier lung-related symptoms and lung damage. If you have severe AAT deficiency, smoking can shorten your life by as much as 20 years.\n                \nAAT deficiency has no cure, but treatments are available. Treatments often are based on the type of disease you develop."

            "question": "What causes Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ?",
            "answer": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an inherited disease. \"Inherited\" means it's passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nChildren who have AAT deficiency inherit two faulty AAT genes, one from each parent. These genes tell cells in the body how to make AAT proteins.\n                \nIn AAT deficiency, the AAT proteins made in the liver aren't the right shape. Thus, they get stuck in the liver cells. The proteins can't get to the organs in the body that they protect, such as the lungs. Without the AAT proteins protecting the organs, diseases can develop.\n                \nThe most common faulty gene that can cause AAT deficiency is called PiZ. If you inherit two PiZ genes (one from each parent), you'll have AAT deficiency.\n                \nIf you inherit a PiZ gene from one parent and a normal AAT gene from the other parent, you won't have AAT deficiency. However, you might pass the PiZ gene to your children.\n                \nEven if you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you may not have any related complications. You may never even realize that you have AAT deficiency."

He or she also may suspect AAT deficiency if you develop emphysema when you're 45 years old or younger.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nMany doctors may be involved in the diagnosis of AAT deficiency. These include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and hepatologists (liver specialists).\n                \nTo diagnose AAT deficiency, your doctor will:\n                \nAsk about possible risk factors. Risk factors include smoking and exposure to dust, fumes, and other toxic substances.\n                \nAsk about your medical history. A common sign of AAT deficiency is if you have a lung or liver disease without any obvious causes or risk factors. Another sign is if you have emphysema at an unusually early age (45 years or younger).\n                \nAsk about your family's medical history. If you have bloodline relatives who have AAT deficiency, you're more likely to have the condition.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests to confirm a diagnosis of AAT deficiency. He or she also may recommend tests to check for lung- or liver-related conditions.\n                \nA genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency. This test will show whether you have faulty AAT genes.\n                \nA blood test also may be used. This test checks the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is a lot lower than normal, it's likely that you have AAT deficiency.\n                \nLung-Related Tests\n                \nIf you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend lung function tests and high-resolution computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scanning, also called CT scanning.\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests may show how severe your lung disease is and how well treatment is working.\n                \nHigh-resolution CT scanning uses x rays to create detailed pictures of parts of the body. A CT scan can show whether you have emphysema or another lung disease and how severe it is."

Most of these treatments are the same as the ones used for a lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n                \nIf you have symptoms related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend:\n                \nMedicines called inhaled bronchodilators (brong-ko-di-LA-tors) and inhaled steroids. These medicines help open your airways and make breathing easier. They also are used to treat asthma and COPD.\n                \nFlu and pneumococcal (noo-mo-KOK-al) vaccines to protect you from illnesses that could make your condition worse. Prompt treatment of lung infections also can help protect your lungs.\n                \nPulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Rehab involves treatment by a team of experts at a special clinic.

A lung transplant may be an option if you have severe breathing problems. If you have a good chance of surviving the transplant surgery, you may be a candidate for it.\n                \nAugmentation (og-men-TA-shun) therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases. This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein. The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs.\n                \nNot enough research has been done to show how well this therapy works. However, some research suggests that this therapy may slow the development of AAT deficiency in people who don't have severe disease.\n                \nPeople who have AAT deficiency and develop related liver or skin diseases will be referred to doctors who treat those diseases.\n                \nFuture Treatments\n                \nResearchers are working on possible treatments that will target the faulty AAT genes and replace them with healthy genes. These treatments are in the early stages of development.\n                \nResearchers also are studying therapies that will help misshapen AAT proteins move from the liver into the bloodstream.

            "question": "What is (are) Mitral Valve Prolapse ?",
            "answer": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a condition in which the hearts mitral valve doesnt work well. The flaps of the valve are floppy and may not close tightly. These flaps normally help seal or open the valve.\n                \nMuch of the time, MVP doesnt cause any problems. Rarely, blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. This can lead topalpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms. (Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.)\n                \nNormal Mitral Valve\n                \nThe mitral valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers of the left side of the heart. The upper chamber is called the left atrium. The lower chamber is called the left ventricle.\n                \nThe mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle, but not back the other way. The heart also has a right atrium and ventricle, separated by the tricuspid valve.\n                \nWith each heartbeat, the atria contract and push blood into the ventricles. The flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves open to let blood through. Then, the ventricles contract to pump the blood out of the heart.\n                \nWhen the ventricles contract, the flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves close. They form a tight seal that prevents blood from flowing back into the atria.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health TopicsHow the Heart Worksarticle. This article contains animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your hearts electrical system works.\n                \nMitral Valve Prolapse\n                \nIn MVP, when the left ventricle contracts, one or both flaps of the mitral valve flop or bulge back (prolapse) into the left atrium. This can prevent the valve from forming a tight seal. As a result, blood may leak from the ventricle back into the atrium. The backflow of blood is called regurgitation.\n                \nMVP doesnt always cause backflow. In fact, most people who have MVP dont have backflow and never have any related symptoms or problems. When backflow occurs, it can get worse over time and itcan change the hearts size and raise pressure in the left atrium and lungs. Backflow also raises the risk of heart valve infections.\n                \nMedicines can treat troublesome MVP symptoms and help prevent complications. Some people will need surgery to repair or replace their mitral valves.\n                \nMitral Valve Prolapse"

They don't have any symptoms or major mitral valve backflow.\n                \nWhen MVP does cause signs and symptoms, they may include:\n                \nPalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast)\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nCough\n                \nFatigue (tiredness), dizziness, or anxiety\n                \nMigraine headaches\n                \nChest discomfort\n                \nMVP symptoms can vary from one person to another. They tend to be mild but can worsen over time, mainly when complications occur.\n                \nMitral Valve Prolapse Complications\n                \nMVP complications are rare. When present, they're most often caused by the backflow of blood through the mitral valve.\n                \nMitral valve backflow is most common among men and people who have high blood pressure. People who have severe backflow may need valve surgery to prevent complications.\n                \nMitral valve backflow causes blood to flow from the left ventricle back into the left atrium. Blood can even back up from the atrium into the lungs, causing shortness of breath.\n                \nThe backflow of blood strains the muscles of both the atrium and the ventricle. Over time, the strain can lead to arrhythmias. Backflow also increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves.\n                \nArrhythmias\n                \nArrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. The most common types of arrhythmias are harmless. Other arrhythmias can be serious or even life threatening, such as ventricular arrhythmias.\n                \nIf the heart rate is too slow, too fast, or irregular, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.\n                \nOne troublesome arrhythmia that MVP can cause is atrial fibrillation (AF). In AF, the walls of the atria quiver instead of beating normally. As a result, the atria aren't able to pump blood into the ventricles the way they should.\n                \nAF is bothersome but rarely life threatening, unless the atria contract very fast or blood clots form in the atria. Blood clots can occur because some blood \"pools\" in the atria instead of flowing into the ventricles. If a blood clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, it can reach the brain and cause a stroke.\n                \nInfection of the Mitral Valve\n                \nA deformed mitral valve flap can attract bacteria in the bloodstream. The bacteria attach to the valve and can cause a serious infection called infective endocarditis (IE). Signs and symptoms of a bacterial infection include fever, chills, body aches, and headaches.\n                \nIE doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's serious. MVP is the most common heart condition that puts people at risk for this infection.\n                \nIf you have MVP, you can take steps to prevent IE. Floss and brush your teeth regularly. Gum infections and tooth decay can cause IE."

            "question": "How to diagnose Mitral Valve Prolapse ?",
            "answer": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) most often is detected during a routine physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope.\n                \nStretched valve flaps can make a clicking sound as they shut. If the mitral valve is leaking blood back into the left atrium, your doctor may heart a heart murmur or whooshing sound.\n                \nHowever, these abnormal heart sounds may come and go. Your doctor may not hear them at the time of an exam, even if you have MVP. Thus, you also may have tests and procedures to diagnose MVP.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is the most useful test for diagnosing MVP. This painless test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart.\n                \nEcho shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. The test also can show areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally because of poor blood flow or injury to the heart muscle.\n                \nEcho can show prolapse of the mitral valve flaps and backflow of blood through the leaky valve.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. Stress echo is done before and after a stress test. During a stress test, you exercise or take medicine (given by your doctor) to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nYou may have stress echo to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of coronary heart disease).\n                \nEcho also can be done by placing a tiny probe in your esophagus to get a closer look at the mitral valve. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach.\n                \nThe probe uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. This form of echo is called transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echocardiography, or TEE.\n                \nDoppler Ultrasound\n                \nA Doppler ultrasound is part of an echo test. A Doppler ultrasound shows the speed and direction of blood flow through the mitral valve.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests that can help diagnose MVP include:\n                \nA chest x ray. This test is used to look for fluid in your lungs or to show whether your heart is enlarged.\n                \nAn EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. An EKG can show how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. This test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart."

Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery is done only if the mitral valve is very abnormal and blood is flowing back into the atrium. The main goal of surgery is to improve symptoms and reduce the risk ofheart failure.\n                \nThe timing of the surgery is important. If its done too early and your leaking valve is working fairly well, you may be put at needless risk from surgery. If its done too late, you may have heart damage that can't be fixed.\n                \nSurgical Approaches\n                \nTraditionally, heart surgeons repair or replace a mitral valve by making an incision (cut) in the breastbone and exposing the heart.\n                \nA small but growing number of surgeons are using another approach that involves one or more small cuts through the side of the chest wall. This results in less cutting, reduced blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. However, not all hospitals offer this method.\n                \nValve Repair and Valve Replacement\n                \nIn mitral valve surgery, the valve is repaired or replaced. Valve repair is preferred when possible. Repair is less likely than replacement to weaken the heart. Repair also lowers the risk of infection and decreases the need for lifelong use of blood-thinning medicines.\n                \nIf repair isnt an option, the valve can be replaced. Mechanical and biological valves are used as replacement valves.\n                \nMechanical valves are man-made and can last a lifetime. People who have mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.\n                \nBiological valves are taken from cows or pigs or made from human tissue. Many people who have biological valves dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives. The major drawback of biological valves is that they weaken over time and often last only about 10 years.\n                \nAfter surgery, youll likely stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for 2 to 3 days. Overall, most people who have mitral valve surgery spend about 1 to 2 weeks in the hospital. Complete recovery takes a few weeks to several months, depending on your health before surgery.\n                \nIf youve had valve repair or replacement, you may need antibiotics before dental work and surgery. These procedures can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. Antibiotics can help prevent infective endocarditis, a serious heart valve infection. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to take antibiotics before such procedures.\n                \nTranscatheter Valve Therapy\n                \nInterventional cardiologists may be able to repair leaky mitral valves by implanting a device using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. This approach is less invasive and can prevent a person from havingopen-heart surgery. At present, the device is only approved for people with severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery."

            "question": "How to prevent Mitral Valve Prolapse ?",
            "answer": "You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Most people who have the condition are born with it.\n                \nComplications from MVP, such as arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and infective endocarditis (IE), are rare. IE is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves.\n                \nPeople at high risk for IE may be given antibiotics before some types of surgery and dental work. Antibiotics can help prevent IE. Your doctor will tell you whether you need this type of treatment.\n                \nPeople at high risk for IE may include those who've had valve repair or replacement or who have some types of underlying heart disease."

            "question": "What is (are) Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move your legs. This urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in your legs. Moving your legs relieves the urge and the unpleasant feelings.\n                \nPeople who have RLS describe the unpleasant feelings as creeping, crawling, pulling, itching, tingling, burning, aching, or electric shocks. Sometimes, these feelings also occur in the arms.\n                \nThe urge to move and unpleasant feelings happen when you're resting and inactive. Thus, they tend to be worse in the evening and at night.\n                \nOverview\n                \nRLS can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. It may make you feel tired and sleepy during the day. This can make it hard to learn, work, and do other daily activities. Not getting enough sleep also can cause depression, mood swings, or other health problems.\n                \nRLS can range from mild to severe based on:\n                \nThe strength of your symptoms and how often they occur\n                \nHow easily moving around relieves your symptoms\n                \nHow much your symptoms disturb your sleep\n                \nOne type of RLS usually starts early in life (before 45 years of age) and tends to run in families. It may even start in childhood. Once this type of RLS starts, it usually lasts for the rest of your life. Over time, symptoms slowly get worse and occur more often. If you have a mild case, you may have long periods with no symptoms.\n                \nAnother type of RLS usually starts later in life (after 45 years of age). It generally doesn't run in families. This type of RLS tends to have a more abrupt onset. The symptoms usually don't get worse over time.\n                \nSome diseases, conditions, and medicines may trigger RLS. For example, the disorder has been linked to kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. When a disease, condition, or medicine causes RLS, the symptoms usually start suddenly.\n                \nMedical conditions or medicines often cause or worsen the type of RLS that starts later in life.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nRLS symptoms often get worse over time. However, some people's symptoms go away for weeks to months.\n                \nIf a medical condition or medicine triggers RLS, the disorder may go away if the trigger is relieved or stopped. For example, RLS that occurs due to pregnancy tends to go away after giving birth. Kidney transplants (but not dialysis) relieve RLS linked to kidney failure.\n                \nTreatments for RLS include lifestyle changes and medicines. Some simple lifestyle changes often help relieve mild cases of RLS. Medicines often can relieve or prevent the symptoms of more severe RLS.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to better understand the causes of RLS and to find better treatments."

            "question": "What causes Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Faulty Use of Iron or Lack of Iron\n                \nResearch suggests that the main cause of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a faulty use of iron or a lack of iron in the brain. The brain uses iron to make the chemical dopamine (DO-pah-meen) and to control other brain activities. Dopamine works in the parts of the brain that control movement.\n                \nMany conditions can affect how much iron is in the brain or how it's used. These conditions include kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. All of these conditions increase your risk of RLS.\n                \nPeople whose family members have RLS also are more likely to develop the disorder. This suggests that genetics may contribute to the faulty use of iron or lack of iron in the brain that triggers RLS.\n                \nNerve Damage\n                \nNerve damage in the legs or feet and sometimes in the arms or hands may cause or worsen RLS. Several conditions can cause this type of nerve damage, including diabetes.\n                \nMedicines and Substances\n                \nCertain medicines may trigger RLS. These include some:\n                \nAntinausea medicines (used to treat upset stomach)\n                \nAntidepressants (used to treat depression)\n                \nAntipsychotics (used to treat certain mental health disorders)\n                \nCold and allergy medicines that contain antihistamines\n                \nCalcium channel blockers (used to treat heart problems and high blood pressure)\n                \nRLS symptoms usually get better or may even go away if the medicine is stopped.\n                \nCertain substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, also can trigger or worsen RLS symptoms. Symptoms may get better or go away if the substances are stopped."

            "answer": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects about 515 percent of Americans. Many people who have RLS have family members with the disorder.\n                \nRLS can affect people of any racial or ethnic group, but the disorder is more common in people of Northern European descent. RLS affects both genders, but women are more likely to have it than men.\n                \nThe number of cases of RLS rises with age. Many people who have RLS are diagnosed in middle age. People who develop RLS early in life tend to have a family history of the disorder.\n                \nPeople who have certain diseases or conditions or who take certain medicines are more likely to develop RLS. (For more information, go to \"What Causes Restless Legs Syndrome?\")\n                \nFor example, pregnancy is a risk factor for RLS. It usually occurs during the last 3 months of pregnancy. The disorder usually improves or goes away after giving birth. Some women may continue to have symptoms after giving birth. Other women may develop RLS again later in life."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "The four key signs of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are:\n                \nA strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms.\n                \nSymptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting.\n                \nRelief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings.\n                \nSymptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night.\n                \nYou must have all four of these signs to be diagnosed with RLS.\n                \nThe Urge To Move\n                \nRLS gets its name from the urge to move the legs when sitting or lying down. This movement relieves the unpleasant feelings that RLS sometimes causes. Typical movements are:\n                \nPacing and walking\n                \nJiggling the legs\n                \nStretching and flexing\n                \nTossing and turning\n                \nRubbing the legs\n                \nUnpleasant Feelings\n                \nPeople who have RLS describe the unpleasant feelings in their limbs as creeping, crawling, pulling, itching, tingling, burning, aching, or electric shocks. Severe RLS may cause painful feelings. However, the pain usually is more of an ache than a sharp, stabbing pain.\n                \nChildren may describe RLS symptoms differently than adults. In children, the condition may occur with hyperactivity. However, it's not fully known how the disorders are related.\n                \nThe unpleasant feelings from RLS often occur in the lower legs (calves). But the feelings can occur at any place in the legs or feet. They also can occur in the arms.\n                \nThe feelings seem to come from deep within the limbs, rather than from the surface. You usually will have the feelings in both legs. However, the feelings can occur in one leg, move from one leg to the other, or affect one leg more than the other.\n                \nPeople who have mild symptoms may notice them only when they're still or awake for a long time, such as on a long airplane trip or while watching TV. If they fall asleep quickly, they may not have symptoms when lying down at night.\n                \nThe unpleasant feelings from RLS aren't the same as the leg cramps many people get at night. Leg cramps often are limited to certain muscle groups in the leg, which you can feel tightening. Leg cramps cause more severe pain and require stretching the affected muscle for relief.\n                \nSometimes arthritis or peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) can cause pain or discomfort in the legs. Moving the limbs usually worsens the discomfort instead of relieving it.\n                \nPeriodic Limb Movement in Sleep\n                \nMany people who have RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS). PLMS causes your legs or arms to twitch or jerk about every 10 to 60 seconds during sleep. These movements cause you to wake up often and get less sleep.\n                \nPLMS usually affects the legs, but it also can affect the arms. Not everyone who has PLMS also has RLS.\n                \nRelated Sleep Problems\n                \nRLS can make it hard to fall or stay asleep. If RLS disturbs your sleep, you may feel very tired during the day.\n                \nLack of sleep may make it hard for you to concentrate at school or work. Not enough sleep also can cause depression, mood swings, and other health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure."

            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose restless legs syndrome (RLS) based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nYour doctor will use this information to rule out other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nYour primary care doctor usually can diagnose and treat RLS. However, he or she also may suggest that you see a sleep specialist or neurologist.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nYou must have the four key signs of RLS to be diagnosed with the disorder.\n                \nYour doctor will want to know how your symptoms are affecting your sleep and how alert you are during the day.\n                \nTo help your doctor, you may want to keep a sleep diary. Use the diary to keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep, how much sleep you get at night, and how alert you feel during the day.\n                \nFor a sample sleep diary, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether you have any of the diseases or conditions that can trigger RLS.

Some medicines can trigger or worsen RLS.\n                \nThe most common type of RLS tends to run in families. Thus, your doctor may ask whether any of your relatives have RLS.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for underlying conditions that may trigger RLS. He or she also will check for other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nCurrently, no test can diagnose RLS. Still, your doctor may recommend blood tests to measure your iron levels. He or she also may suggest muscle or nerve tests. These tests can show whether you have a condition that can worsen RLS or that has symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nRarely, sleep studies are used to help diagnose RLS. A sleep study measures how much and how well you sleep. Although RLS can cause a lack of sleep, this sign isn't specific enough to diagnose the condition.\n                \nResearchers continue to study new ways to diagnose RLS.\n                \nDrug Therapy Trial\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have RLS, he or she may prescribe certain medicines to relieve your symptoms.

Remove things that can interfere with sleep, such as a TV, computer, or phone.\n                \nGoing to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Some people who have RLS find it helpful to go to bed later in the evening and get up later in the morning.\n                \nAvoiding staying in bed awake for long periods in the evening or during the night.\n                \nDoing a challenging activity before bedtime, such as solving a crossword puzzle, may ease your RLS symptoms. This distraction may make it easier for you to fall asleep. Focusing on your breathing and using other relaxation techniques also may help you fall asleep.\n                \nRegular, moderate physical activity also can help limit or prevent RLS symptoms.

Many medicines can relieve or prevent RLS symptoms.\n                \nNo single medicine works for all people who have RLS. It may take several changes in medicines and dosages to find the best approach. Sometimes, a medicine will work for a while and then stop working.\n                \nSome of the medicines used to treat RLS also are used to treat Parkinson's disease. These medicines make dopamine or mimic it in the parts of the brain that control movement. (Dopamine is a chemical that helps you move properly.)\n                \nIf medicines for Parkinson's disease don't prevent or relieve your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe other medicines. You may have to take more than one medicine to treat your RLS.\n                \nAlways talk with your doctor before taking any medicines. He or she can tell you the side effects of each RLS medicine. Side effects may include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), headache, and daytime sleepiness.\n                \nIn some cases, RLS medicines may worsen problems with excessive gambling, shopping, or sexual activity.

            "question": "What is (are) Metabolic Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Metabolicsyndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nThe term \"metabolic\" refers to the biochemical processes involved in the body's normal functioning. Risk factors are traits, conditions, or habits that increase your chance of developing a disease.\n                \nIn this article, \"heart disease\" refers to coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nPlaque hardens and narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to your heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, a heart attack, heart damage, or even death.\n                \nMetabolic Risk Factors\n                \nThe five conditions described below are metabolic risk factors. You can have any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. You must have at least three metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.\n                \nA large waistline. This also is called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Excess fat in the stomach area is a greater risk factor for heart disease than excess fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\n                \nA high triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\n                \nA low HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A low HDL cholesterol level raises your risk for heart disease.\n                \nHigh blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure). Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to plaque buildup.\n                \nHigh fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat high blood sugar). Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes.\n                \nOverview\n                \nYour risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke increases with the number of metabolic risk factors you have. The risk of having metabolic syndrome is closely linked to overweight and obesity and a lack of physical activity.\n                \nInsulin resistance also may increase your risk for metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body cant use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels, and its closely linked to overweight and obesity.Genetics (ethnicity and family history) and older age are other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is becoming more common due to a rise in obesity rates among adults. In the future, metabolic syndrome may overtake smoking as the leading risk factor for heart disease.\n                \nIt is possible to prevent or delay metabolic syndrome, mainly with lifestyle changes. A healthy lifestyle is a lifelong commitment. Successfully controlling metabolic syndrome requires long-term effort and teamwork with your health care providers."

Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks.\n                \nOther groups at increased risk for metabolic syndrome include:\n                \nPeople who have a personal history of diabetes\n                \nPeople who have a sibling or parent who hasdiabetes\n                \nWomen when compared with men\n                \nWomen who have a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries)\n                \nHeart Disease Risk\n                \nMetabolic syndrome increases your risk for coronary heart disease. Other risk factors, besides metabolic syndrome, also increase your risk for heart disease. For example, a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease. For details about all of the risk factors for heart disease, go to the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors HealthTopic.\n                \nEven if you dont have metabolic syndrome, you should find out your short-term risk for heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) divides short-term heart disease risk into four categories. Your risk category depends on which risk factors you have and how many you have.\n                \nYour risk factors are used to calculate your 10-year risk of developing heart disease. The NCEP has an online calculator that you can use to estimate your 10-year risk of having a heart attack.\n                \nHigh risk: Youre in this category if you already have heart disease or diabetes, or if your 10-year risk score is more than 20 percent.\n                \nModerately high risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is 10 percent to 20 percent.\n                \nModerate risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is less than 10 percent.\n                \nLower risk: Youre in this category if you have zero or one risk factor.\n                \nEven if your 10-year risk score isnt high, metabolic syndrome will increase your risk for coronary heart disease over time."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. These risk factors can increase your risk for health problems even if they're only moderately raised (borderline-high risk factors).\n                \nMost of the metabolic risk factors have no signs or symptoms, although a large waistline is a visible sign.\n                \nSome people may have symptoms of high blood sugar if diabetesespecially type 2 diabetesis present. Symptoms of high blood sugar often include increased thirst; increased urination, especially at night; fatigue (tiredness); and blurred vision.\n                \nHigh blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms. However, some people in the early stages of high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells, or more nosebleeds than usual."

            "question": "How to diagnose Metabolic Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the five metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.\n                \nMetabolic Risk Factors\n                \nA Large Waistline\n                \nHaving a large waistline means that you carry excess weight around your waist (abdominal obesity). This is also called having an \"apple-shaped\" figure. Your doctor will measure your waist to find out whether you have a large waistline.\n                \nA waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women or 40 inches or more for men is a metabolic risk factor. A large waistline means you're at increased risk for heart disease and other health problems.\n                \nA High Triglyceride Level\n                \nTriglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. A triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mg/dL is milligrams per deciliterthe units used to measure triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar.)\n                \nA Low HDL Cholesterol Level\n                \nHDL cholesterol sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nAn HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (or being on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol) is a metabolic risk factor.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nA blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nIf only one of your two blood pressure numbers is high, you're still at risk for metabolic syndrome.\n                \nHigh Fasting Blood Sugar\n                \nA normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level between 100125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes.\n                \nA fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is a metabolic risk factor.\n                \nAbout 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetesthe most common type of diabetesalso have metabolic syndrome. These people have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Metabolic Syndrome ?",
            "answer": "Heart-healthy lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment for metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity, and quittingsmoking.\n                \nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines. Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, and high blood sugar.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nThe major goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Treatment is directed first at lowering LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure and managing diabetes (if these conditions are present).\n                \nThe second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type2 diabetes, if it hasnt already developed. Long-term complications of diabetes often include heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and foot or leg amputation. If diabetes is present, the goal of treatment is to reduce your risk for heart disease by controlling all of your risk factors.\n                \n\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nHeart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nIf you eat:\n                \nTry to eat no more than:\n                \n1,200 calories a day                     \n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day            \n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nLimiting Alcohol\n                \nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.\n                \nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nIf you have metabolic syndrome and are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend weight loss. He or she can help you create a weight-loss plan and goals. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \n\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\n                \n\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for heart disease and heart attack and worsen other heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHeart disease or had a prior stroke\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\n                \nLower your blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\n                \nReduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your risk factors for metabolic syndrome."

            "question": "What is (are) Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency ?",
            "answer": "Sleep deprivation (DEP-rih-VA-shun) is a condition that occurs if you don't get enough sleep. Sleep deficiency is a broader concept. It occurs if you have one or more of the following:\n                \nYou don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation)\n                \nYou sleep at the wrong time of day (that is, you're out of sync with your body's natural clock)\n                \nYou don't sleep well or get all of the different types of sleep that your body needs\n                \nYou have a sleep disorder that prevents you from getting enough sleep or causes poor quality sleep\n                \nThis article focuses on sleep deficiency, unless otherwise noted.\n                \nSleeping is a basic human need, like eating, drinking, and breathing. Like these other needs, sleeping is a vital part of the foundation for good health and well-being throughout your lifetime.\n                \nSleep deficiency can lead to physical and mental health problems, injuries, loss of productivity, and even a greater risk of death.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand sleep deficiency, it helps to understand how sleep works and why it's important. The two basic types of sleep are rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM.\n                \nNon-REM sleep includes what is commonly known as deep sleep or slow wave sleep. Dreaming typically occurs during REM sleep. Generally, non-REM and REM sleep occur in a regular pattern of 35 cycles each night.\n                \nYour ability to function and feel well while you're awake depends on whether you're getting enough total sleep and enough of each type of sleep. It also depends on whether you're sleeping at a time when your body is prepared and ready to sleep.\n                \nYou have an internal \"body clock\" that controls when you're awake and when your body is ready for sleep. This clock typically follows a 24-hour repeating rhythm (called the circadian rhythm). The rhythm affects every cell, tissue, and organ in your body and how they work. (For more information, go to \"What Makes You Sleep?\")\n                \nIf you aren't getting enough sleep, are sleeping at the wrong times, or have poor quality sleep, you'll likely feel very tired during the day. You may not feel refreshed and alert when you wake up.\n                \nSleep deficiency can interfere with work, school, driving, and social functioning. You might have trouble learning, focusing, and reacting. Also, you might find it hard to judge other people's emotions and reactions. Sleep deficiency also can make you feel frustrated, cranky, or worried in social situations.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of sleep deficiency may differ between children and adults. Children who are sleep deficient might be overly active and have problems paying attention. They also might misbehave, and their school performance can suffer.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nSleep deficiency is a common public health problem in the United States. People in all age groups report not getting enough sleep.\n                \nAs part of a health survey for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 719 percent of adults in the United States reported not getting enough rest or sleep every day. \n                \nNearly 40 percent of adults report falling asleep during the day without meaning to at least once a month. Also, an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans have chronic (ongoing) sleep disorders.\n                \nSleep deficiency is linked to many chronic health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression.\n                \nSleep deficiency also is associated with an increased risk of injury in adults, teens, and children. For example, driver sleepiness (not related to alcohol) is responsible for serious car crash injuries and death. In the elderly, sleep deficiency might be linked to an increased risk of falls and broken bones.\n                \nIn addition, sleep deficiency has played a role in human errors linked to tragic accidents, such as nuclear reactor meltdowns, grounding of large ships, and aviation accidents.\n                \nA common myth is that people can learn to get by on little sleep with no negative effects. However, research shows that getting enough quality sleep at the right times is vital for mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety."

            "answer": "Sleep deficiency, which includes sleep deprivation, affects people of all ages, races, and ethnicities. Certain groups of people may be more likely to be sleep deficient. Examples include people who:\n                \nHave limited time available for sleep, such as caregivers or people working long hours or more than one job\n                \nHave schedules that conflict with their internal body clocks, such as shift workers, first responders, teens who have early school schedules, or people who must travel for work\n                \nMake lifestyle choices that prevent them from getting enough sleep, such as taking medicine to stay awake, abusing alcohol or drugs, or not leaving enough time for sleep\n                \nHave undiagnosed or untreated medical problems, such as stress, anxiety, or sleep disorders\n                \nHave medical conditions or take medicines that interfere with sleep\n                \nCertain medical conditions have been linked to sleep disorders.

Reducing exposure to mosquito bites is the best defense against getting infected with LACV or other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. \n \n - Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin as well as on clothing (mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth). \n   \n   - Permethrin is a repellent/insecticide that can be applied to clothing and will provide excellent protection through multiple washes. You can treat clothing yourself (always follow the directions on the package!) or purchase pre-treated clothing. For best protection it is still necessary to apply other repellent to exposed skin.  \n    \n - Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves, pants and socks when weather permits. \n - Avoid peak biting hours: Avoid outdoor activity or use protective measures when mosquitoes are active (Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes are most active during daytime\u2014from dawn until dusk). \n - Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  \n - Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. While Aedes triseriatus prefers treeholes, it will also lay eggs in artificial containers. You can fill treeholes in/around your yard with soil. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.  \n"

However, on the basis of limited information, it appears that symptoms may develop between 1 and 5 weeks after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.\n  Early Symptoms\n  \n    \n   \nEarly symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups\u2014thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal.\n   \nThere may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.\n  \n  Late Symptoms\n  \n    \n   \nFour to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a \"...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face\" as the lungs fill with fluid.\n  \n  Is the Disease Fatal?\n  \nYes. HPS can be fatal. It has a mortality rate of 38%."

            "question": "how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?",
            "answer": "Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.\n  \nRecent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all. Therefore, if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live, try to keep your home, vacation place, workplace, or campsite clean.\n  \nFor more information on how you can prevent rodent infestations, the following information is available on the CDC Rodents site:"

            "question": "what is the history of hps for Hantavirus ?",
            "answer": "The \"First\"Outbreak\n  \nIn May 1993, an outbreak of an unexplained pulmonary illness occurred in the southwestern United States, in an area shared by Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah known as \"The Four Corners\". A young, physically fit Navajo man suffering from shortness of breath was rushed to a hospital in New Mexico and died very rapidly.\n   \n  \nWhile reviewing the results of the case, medical personnel discovered that the young man's fianc\u00e9e had died a few days before after showing similar symptoms, a piece of information that proved key to discovering the disease. As Dr. James Cheek of the Indian Health Service (IHS) noted, \"I think if it hadn't been for that initial pair of people that became sick within a week of each other, we never would have discovered the illness at all\".\n  \nAn investigation combing the entire Four Corners region was launched by the New Mexico Office of Medical Investigations (OMI) to find any other people who had a similar case history. Within a few hours, Dr. Bruce Tempest of IHS, working with OMI, had located five young, healthy people who had all died after acute respiratory failure.\n  \nA series of laboratory tests had failed to identify any of the deaths as caused by a known disease, such as bubonic plague. At this point, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch was notified. CDC, the state health departments of New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, the Indian Health Service, the Navajo Nation, and the University of New Mexico all joined together to confront the outbreak.\n   \n  \nDuring the next few weeks, as additional cases of the disease were reported in the Four Corners area, physicians and other scientific experts worked intensively to narrow down the list of possible causes. The particular mixture of symptoms and clinical findings pointed researchers away from possible causes, such as exposure to a herbicide or a new type of influenza, and toward some type of virus. Samples of tissue from patients who had gotten the disease were sent to CDC for exhaustive analysis. Virologists at CDC used several tests, including new methods to pinpoint virus genes at the molecular level, and were able to link the pulmonary syndrome with a virus, in particular a previously unknown type of hantavirus.\n  Researchers Launch Investigations to Pin Down the Carrier of the New Virus\n   \n  \nResearchers knew that all other known hantaviruses were transmitted to people by rodents, such as mice and rats. Therefore, an important part of their mission was to trap as many different species of rodents living in the Four Corners region as possible to find the particular type of rodent that carried the virus. From June through mid-August of 1993, all types of rodents were trapped inside and outside homes where people who had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome had lived, as well as in pi\u00f1on groves and summer sheep camps where they had worked. Additional rodents were trapped for comparison in and around nearby households as well. Taking a calculated risk, researchers decided not to wear protective clothing or masks during the trapping process. \"We didn't want to go in wearing respirators, scaring...everybody\", John Sarisky, an Indian Health Service environmental disease specialist said. However, when the almost 1,700 rodents trapped were dissected to prepare samples for analysis at CDC, protective clothing and respirators were worn.\n  \nAmong rodents trapped, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was found to be the main host to a previously unknown type of hantavirus. Since the deer mouse often lives near people in rural and semi-rural areas\u2014in barns and outbuildings, woodpiles, and inside people's homes\u2014researchers suspected that the deer mouse might be transmitting the virus to humans. About 30% of the deer mice tested showed evidence of infection with hantavirus. Tests also showed that several other types of rodents were infected, although in lesser numbers.\n  \nThe next step was to pin down the connection between the infected deer mice and households where people who had gotten the disease lived. Therefore, investigators launched a case-control investigation. They compared \"case\" households, where people who had gotten the disease lived, with nearby \"control\" households. Control households were similar to those where the case-patients lived, except for one factor: no one in the control households had gotten the disease.\n  \nThe results? First, investigators trapped more rodents in case households than in control households, so more rodents may have been living in close contact with people in case households. Second, people in case households were more likely than those in control households to do cleaning around the house or to plant in or hand-plow soil outdoors in fields or gardens. However, it was unclear if the risk for contracting HPS was due to performing these tasks, or with entering closed-up rooms or closets to get tools needed for these tasks.\n  \nIn November 1993, the specific hantavirus that caused the Four Corners outbreak was isolated. The Special Pathogens Branch at CDC used tissue from a deer mouse that had been trapped near the New Mexico home of a person who had gotten the disease and grew the virus from it in the laboratory. Shortly afterwards and independently, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) also grew the virus, from a person in New Mexico who had gotten the disease as well as from a mouse trapped in California.\n   \n  \nThe new virus was called Muerto Canyon virus \u2014 later changed to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) \u2014 and the new disease caused by the virus was named hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS.\n  \nThe isolation of the virus in a matter of months was remarkable. This success was based on close cooperation of all the agencies and individuals involved in investigating the outbreak, years of basic research on other hantaviruses that had been conducted at CDC and USAMRIID, and on the continuing development of modern molecular virologic tests. To put the rapid isolation of the Sin Nombre virus in perspective, it took several decades for the first hantavirus discovered, the Hantaan virus, to be isolated.\n  \n                \n  HPS Not Really a New Disease\n  \nAs part of the effort to locate the source of the virus, researchers located and examined stored samples of lung tissue from people who had died of unexplained lung disease. Some of these samples showed evidence of previous infection with Sin Nombre virus\u2014indicating that the disease had existed before the \"first\" known outbreak\u2014it simply had not been recognized!\n  \nOther early cases of HPS have been discovered by examining samples of tissue belonging to people who had died of unexplained adult respiratory distress syndrome. By this method, the earliest known case of HPS that has been confirmed has been the case of a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.\n  \nInterestingly, while HPS was not known to the epidemiologic and medical communities, there is evidence that it was recognized elsewhere. The Navajo Indians, a number of whom contracted HPS during the 1993 outbreak, recognize a similar disease in their medical traditions, and actually associate its occurrence with mice. As strikingly, Navajo medical beliefs concur with public health recommendations for preventing the disease.\n  \n                \n  Why Did the Outbreak Occur in the Four Corners Area?\n  \nBut why this sudden cluster of cases? The key answer to this question is that, during this period, there were suddenly many more mice than usual. The Four Corners area had been in a drought for several years. Then, in early 1993, heavy snows and rainfall helped drought-stricken plants and animals to revive and grow in larger-than-usual numbers. The area's deer mice had plenty to eat, and as a result they reproduced so rapidly that there were ten times more mice in May 1993 than there had been in May of 1992. With so many mice, it was more likely that mice and humans would come into contact with one another, and thus more likely that the hantavirus carried by the mice would be transmitted to humans.\n  \n                \n  Person-to-Person Spread of HPS Decided Unlikely\n  \n\"Although person-to-person spread [of HPS] has not been documented with any of the other known hantaviruses, we were concerned [during this outbreak] because we were dealing with a new agent\", said Charles Vitek, a CDC medical investigator.\n  \nResearchers and clinicians investigating the ongoing outbreak were not the only groups concerned about the disease. Shortly after the first few HPS patients died and it became clear that a new disease was affecting people in the area, and that no one knew how it was transmitted, the news media began extensive reporting on the outbreak. Widespread concern among the public ensued.\n  \nUnfortunately, the first victims of the outbreak were Navajo. News reports focused on this fact, and the misperception grew that the unknown disease was somehow linked to Navajos. As a consequence, Navajos found themselves at the center of intense media attention and the objects of the some people's fears.\n  \nBy later in the summer of 1993, the media frenzy had quieted somewhat, and the source of the disease was pinpointed. Researchers determined that, like other hantaviruses, the virus that causes HPS is not transmitted from person to person the way other infections, such as the common cold, may be. The exception to this is an outbreak of HPS in Argentina in 1996. Evidence from this outbreak suggests that strains of hantaviruses in South America may be transmissable from person to person.\n  \nTo date, no cases of HPS have been reported in the United States in which the virus was transmitted from one person to another. In fact, in a study of health care workers who were exposed to either patients or specimens infected with related types of hantaviruses (which cause a different disease in humans), none of the workers showed evidence of infection or illness.\n  \n                \n  HPS Since the First Outbreak\n  \nAfter the initial outbreak, the medical community nationwide was asked to report any cases of illness with symptoms similar to those of HPS that could not be explained by any other cause. As a result, additional cases have been reported.\n  \nSince 1993, researchers have discovered that there is not just one hantavirus that causes HPS, but several. In June 1993, a Louisiana bridge inspector who had not traveled to the Four Corners area developed HPS. An investigation was begun. The patient's tissues were tested for the presence of antibodies to hantavirus. The results led to the discovery of another hantavirus, named Bayou virus, which was linked to a carrier, the rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). In late 1993, a 33-year-old Florida man came down with HPS symptoms; he later recovered. This person also had not traveled to the Four Corners area. A similar investigation revealed yet another hantavirus, named the Black Creek Canal virus, and its carrier, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus). Another case occurred in New York. This time, the Sin Nombre-like virus was named New York-1, and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), was implicated as the carrier.\n  \nMore recently, cases of HPS stemming from related hantaviruses have been documented in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, making HPS a pan-hemispheric disease.\n  \n                \n  References\n  \nInformation for this page was developed using the CDC video Preventing Hantavirus Disease and resource articles listed in the bibliography."

            "answer": "Yersiniosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus Yersinia. In the United States, most human illness is caused by one species, Y. enterocolitica. Infection with Y. enterocolitica can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the age of the person infected. Infection with Y. enterocolitica occurs most often in young children. Common symptoms in children are fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Symptoms typically develop 4 to 7 days after exposure and may last 1 to 3 weeks or longer. In older children and adults, right-sided abdominal pain and fever may be the predominant symptoms, and may be confused with appendicitis. In a small proportion of cases, complications such as skin rash, joint pains, or spread of bacteria to the bloodstream can occur."

            "question": "how vaccines prevent disease",
            "answer": "Why Are Childhood Vaccines So Important? It is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs. Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), mumps, tetanus, rotavirus and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can now be prevented by vaccination. Thanks to a vaccine, one of the most terrible diseases in history \u2013 smallpox \u2013 no longer exists outside the laboratory. Over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. Immunity Protects us From Disease Immunity is the body\u2019s way of preventing disease.  Children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. The immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as \"foreign invaders\u201d (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them. The first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. This takes time . . . usually the immune system can\u2019t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick.  However, the immune system \u201cremembers\u201d that antigen. If it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. This protection is called immunity. It would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first. In fact there is: Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. But the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don\u2019t cause disease. However, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. In other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child\u2019s first exposure to a disease. The child gets protection without having to get sick. Through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent. Top of Page More Facts Newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. However, this immunity goes away during the first year of life. If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don\u2019t see these diseases nearly as often. Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can\u2019t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don\u2019t respond to a particular vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work.

            "answer": "Baylisascaris worms are intestinal parasites found in a wide variety of animals. Different species of Baylisascaris are associated with different animal hosts. For example, Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoons and Baylisascaris columnaris is an intestinal parasite found in skunks. Cases of Baylisascaris infection in people are not frequently reported, but can be severe. Baylisascaris procyonis is thought to pose the greatest risk to humans because of the often close association of raccoons to human dwellings."

        {
            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Baylisascaris infection? ?",
            "answer": "Raccoons are the primary, or definitive, host of Baylisascaris procyonis, a roundworm. Raccoons become infected with Baylisascaris in one of two ways:\n    \n     - Young raccoons become infected by eating eggs during foraging, feeding, and grooming.\n     - Adult raccoons acquire the infection by eating rodents, rabbits, and birds infected with the larvae of Baylisascaris.\n    \n    \nInfected raccoons have been found throughout the United States, mainly in the Midwest, Northeast, Middle Atlantic, and West Coast.\n    \nRaccoons are peridomestic animals, which means they live in or around areas where people live. Roundworm eggs are passed in the feces of infected raccoons. Raccoons defecate in communal sites, called latrines. Raccoon latrines are often found at bases of trees, unsealed attics, or on flat surfaces such as logs, tree stumps, rocks, decks, and rooftops. As more raccoons move into populated areas, the number and density of their latrines will increase.\n    \nWhile raccoons are the roundworm's primary host, other types of animals can become infected. Birds and small mammals, such as rodents and rabbits, are susceptible to the parasite. Unlike raccoons, these animals sometimes show signs of infection, such as muscle spasms, tremors, and progressive weakness; infection can lead to death. Predator animals, including dogs, may become infected by eating an animal that has been infected with Baylisascaris. In some dogs, Baylisascaris may develop to adult worms and pass eggs in the dogs' feces.\n    \nThe worms develop to maturity in the raccoon intestine, where they produce millions of eggs that are passed in the feces. Eggs that are excreted by raccoons are not immediately infectious. These eggs must develop in the environment for 2 to 4 weeks, after which the eggs are able to cause infection. The eggs are resistant to most environmental conditions and with adequate moisture, can survive for years.\n    \n     \n    \n    \nHumans become infected by ingesting embryonated (fertile) eggs. Anyone who is exposed to environments where raccoons frequent is potentially at risk. Young children or developmentally disabled persons are at highest risk for infection as they may be more likely to put contaminated fingers, soil, or objects into their mouths.\n    \nHunters, trappers, taxidermists, and wildlife handlers may also be at increased risk if they have contact with raccoons or raccoon habitats.\n    \nFewer than 25 cases of Baylisascaris disease have been documented in the United States. However, it is possible that some cases are incorrectly diagnosed as other infections or go undiagnosed. Cases that are diagnosed tend to be severe.\n    \nCases have been reported in California, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. As of 2012, there were 16 published human neurological cases in the US; six of the infected persons died."

        {
            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - Baylisascaris infection ?",
            "answer": "If you suspect you have been infected, consult your health care provider immediately. Be sure to tell your health care provider if you have recently been exposed to raccoons or their feces.\n    \nDiagnosis is difficult because symptoms depend on the number of infecting larvae and location in the body. Ocular larva migrans, when the larvae migrate to the eye, can cause sensitivity to light, inflammation of the eye, and blindness. Symptoms of visceral larva migrans, when the larvae travel to organs, depend on which organs are affected. For example, an invasion of the liver may cause hepatomegaly (inflammation and enlargement of the liver), while an invasion of the lung may cause pulmonary symptoms such as cough or chest pain. Larvae rarely end up in the nervous system but the most severe cases are neural larva migrans, when the larvae migrate into the brain and cause it to swell (encephalitis). There is no commercially available test for Baylisascaris infection. A health care provider may test blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue to determine if an individual is infected. Eye examinations may reveal a migrating larva or lesions and are often the most significant clue to infection with Baylisascaris.\n    \nDiagnosis often is made by ruling out other infections that cause similar symptoms. Information on diagnosis and testing can be obtained through your local or state health department or CDC.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis"

            "question": "How to prevent Parasites - Baylisascaris infection ?",
            "answer": "Baylisascaris infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces. Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.\n    \nDo not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. Infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons, so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior. Roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye. Eggs can only be seen using a microscope.\n    \n     \n    \n    \nYou may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps:\n    \n     - prevent access to food\n     - keep trash containers tightly closed\n     - close off access to attics and basements\n     - keep sandboxes covered when not in use (raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine)\n     - remove fish ponds -- they eat the fish and drink the water\n     - eliminate water sources\n     - remove bird feeders\n     - clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property\n    \n    \nStay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces. Raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. Raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. Feces usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items.\n    \nIf you have found a raccoon latrine near your home, cleaning the area may prevent possible infection. Newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become infective. Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.\n    \nMore on: Raccoon Latrine Clean-up [PDF, 111 KB, 1 page]\n    \n     \n    \n    \nIf you choose to clean the site yourself, care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes.\n    \n     - Wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination.\n     - Wear a N95-rated respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials.\n     - Avoid stirring up dust and debris- you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust.\n     - Wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away, so that you do not bring eggs into your household.\n     - Feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill.\n     - Most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs; however, heat kills the eggs instantly.\n     - Treat feces-soiled decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch (please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices).\n    \n    \nTo help further reduce the risk of possible infection, wash your hands well with soap and warm running water. Clean/launder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent.\n    \nMore on: Handwashing\n    \nIf you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch, use a damp (but not wet) sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water. Rinse your sponge frequently. After you are finished, flush dirty water down the toilet. Place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage.\n    \nContact your local animal control office for additional assistance.\n    Dogs\n    \nDogs may be infected with adult B. procyonis roundworms, but may not show symptoms. Have all pets de-wormed under a veterinarian's supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces.\n    Exotic pets\n    \nRaccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of Baylisascaris. B. procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous. Other animals such as coatis may be susceptible. When wild animals are kept as pets, there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans."

            "answer": "A single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii causes a disease known as toxoplasmosis. While the parasite is found throughout the world, more than 60 million people in the United States may be infected with the Toxoplasma parasite. Of those who are infected, very few have symptoms because a healthy person\u2019s immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, pregnant women and individuals who have compromised immune systems should be cautious; for them, a Toxoplasma infection could cause serious health problems."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection)? ?",
            "answer": "Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In the United States it is estimated that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older have been infected with Toxoplasma. In various places throughout the world, it has been shown that up to 95% of some populations have been infected with Toxoplasma. Infection is often highest in areas of the world that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes. \n    \nToxoplasmosis is not passed from person-to-person, except in instances of mother-to-child (congenital) transmission and blood transfusion or organ transplantation. People typically become infected by three principal routes of transmission. \n         \n     \n     \n       \n      \n     \n    \n      \n    Foodborne transmission \n    \nThe tissue form of the parasite (a microscopic cyst consisting of bradyzoites) can be transmitted to humans by food. People become infected by: \n     \n     - Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison) \n     - Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat after handling it and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin) \n     - Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards, or other foods that had contact with raw, contaminated meat \n     \n    \n      \n    Animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission \n    \nCats play an important role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. They become infected by eating infected rodents, birds, or other small animals. The parasite is then passed in the cat's feces in an oocyst form, which is microscopic. \n    \nKittens and cats can shed millions of oocysts in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. A Toxoplasma-infected cat that is shedding the parasite in its feces contaminates the litter box. If the cat is allowed outside, it can contaminate the soil or water in the environment as well. \n     \n       \n      \n     \n    \nPeople can accidentally swallow the oocyst form of the parasite. People can be infected by: \n     \n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after cleaning a cat's litter box when the cat has shed Toxoplasma in its feces \n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after touching or ingesting anything that has come into contact with a cat's feces that contain Toxoplasma \n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts in contaminated soil (e.g., not washing hands after gardening or eating unwashed fruits or vegetables from a garden) \n     - Drinking water contaminated with the Toxoplasma parasite \n     \n    \n      \n    Mother-to-child (congenital) transmission \n    \nA woman who is newly infected with Toxoplasma during pregnancy can pass the infection to her unborn child (congenital infection). The woman may not have symptoms, but there can be severe consequences for the unborn child, such as diseases of the nervous system and eyes. \n    \n      \n    Rare instances of transmission \n    \nOrgan transplant recipients can become infected by receiving an organ from a Toxoplasma-positive donor. Rarely, people can also become infected by receiving infected blood via transfusion. Laboratory workers who handle infected blood can also acquire infection through accidental inoculation."

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) ?",
            "answer": "The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is typically made by serologic testing. A test that measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) is used to determine if a person has been infected. If it is necessary to try to estimate the time of infection, which is of particular importance for pregnant women, a test which measures immunoglobulin M (IgM) is also used along with other tests such as an avidity test.\n    \nDiagnosis can be made by direct observation of the parasite in stained tissue sections, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or other biopsy material. These techniques are used less frequently because of the difficulty of obtaining these specimens.\n    \nParasites can also be isolated from blood or other body fluids (for example, CSF) but this process can be difficult and requires considerable time.\n    \nMolecular techniques that can detect the parasite's DNA in the amniotic fluid can be useful in cases of possible mother-to-child (congenital) transmission.\n    \nOcular disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions in the eye, symptoms, course of disease, and often serologic testing."

In the United States, zoonotic hookworms are found everywhere but more commonly along the East Coast than the West Coast. Worldwide, zoonotic hookworms are found in tropical and subtropical regions where the parasite is better able to survive because of environmental conditions. However, there is one type of dog and cat hookworm that is more commonly found in cooler climates.\n    \nThe global burden of zoonotic hookworm in dogs and cats is not known; also, the amount of disease in people caused by these parasites is also unknown. Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is most often reported by returning travelers to tropical regions who have had soil and/or sand exposures in places where dogs and cats are likely to have hookworms. However, CLM is likely causing significant problems for the people who live in less developed parts of the world, even though the disease is not reported regularly. In less developed areas of the world, dogs and cats are often free-ranging and have high rates of infection with hookworm which leads to widespread contamination of sand and soil. In a survey of a rural population in Brazil, the prevalence of CLM during the rainy season was 14.9% among children less than 5 years old and 0.7% among adults aged 20 years and older."

            "answer": "There are three different filarial species that can cause lymphatic filariasis in humans. Most of the infections worldwide are caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. In Asia, the disease can also be caused by Brugia malayi and Brugia timori.\n    \nThe infection spreads from person to person by mosquito bites. The adult worm lives in the human lymph vessels, mates, and produces millions of microscopic worms, also known as microfilariae. Microfilariae circulate in the person's blood and infect the mosquito when it bites a person who is infected. Microfilariae grow and develop in the mosquito. When the mosquito bites another person, the larval worms pass from the mosquito into the human skin, and travel to the lymph vessels. They grow into adult worms, a process that takes 6 months or more. An adult worm lives for about 5\u20137 years. The adult worms mate and release millions of microfilariae into the blood. People with microfilariae in their blood can serve as a source of infection to others.\n    \n     \n    \n    \nA wide range of mosquitoes can transmit the parasite, depending on the geographic area. In Africa, the most common vector is Anopheles and in the Americas, it is Culex quinquefasciatus. Aedes and Mansonia can transmit the infection in the Pacific and in Asia.\n    \nMany mosquito bites over several months to years are needed to get lymphatic filariasis. People living for a long time in tropical or sub-tropical areas where the disease is common are at the greatest risk for infection. Short-term tourists have a very low risk.\n    \nPrograms to eliminate lymphatic filariasis are under way in more than 50 countries. These programs are reducing transmission of the filarial parasites and decreasing the risk of infection for people living in or visiting these communities.\n    Geographic distribution\n    \n     \n    \n    \nLymphatic filariasis affects over 120 million people in 73 countries throughout the tropics and sub-tropics of Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific, and parts of the Caribbean and South America.\n    \nIn the Americas, only four countries are currently known to be endemic: Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guyana and Brazil.\n    \nIn the United States, Charleston, South Carolina, was the last known place with lymphatic filariasis. The infection disappeared early in the 20th century. Currently, you cannot get infected in the U.S."

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - Lymphatic Filariasis ?",
            "answer": "The standard method for diagnosing active infection is the identification of microfilariae in a blood smear by microscopic examination. The microfilariae that cause lymphatic filariasis circulate in the blood at night (called nocturnal periodicity). Blood collection should be done at night to coincide with the appearance of the microfilariae, and a thick smear should be made and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used.\n    \nSerologic techniques provide an alternative to microscopic detection of microfilariae for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection typically have elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in the blood and these can be detected using routine assays.\n    \nBecause lymphedema may develop many years after infection, lab tests are most likely to be negative with these patients."

The drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms. DEC has been used world-wide for more than 50 years. Because this infection is rare in the U.S., the drug is no longer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cannot be sold in the U.S. Physicians can obtain the medication from CDC after confirmed positive lab results. CDC gives the physicians the choice between 1 or 12-day treatment of DEC (6 mg/kg/day). One day treatment is generally as effective as the 12-day regimen. DEC is generally well tolerated. Side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints.\n    \nDEC should not be administered to patients who may also have onchocerciasis as  DEC can worsen onchocercal eye disease.  In patients with loiasis, DEC can cause serious adverse reactions, including encephalopathy and death. The risk and severity of the adverse reactions are related to Loa loa microfilarial density.\nThe drug ivermectin kills only the microfilariae, but not the adult worm; the adult worm is responsible for the pathology of lymphedema and hydrocele.\n    \nSome studies have shown adult worm killing with treatment with doxycycline (200mg/day for 4\u20136 weeks).  \n    Patients with clinical symptoms\n    \nLymphedema and elephantiasis are not indications for DEC treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite.\n    \nTo prevent the lymphedema from getting worse, patients should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene, exercise and treatment of wounds.\n    \nPatients with hydrocele may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with DEC. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment"

If you live in an area with lymphatic filariasis:\n   \n    - at night \n     \n      - sleep in an air-conditioned room or\n      - sleep under a mosquito net\n     \n    - between dusk and dawn \n     \n      - wear long sleeves and trousers and\n      - use mosquito repellent on exposed skin.\n     \n   \n   \nAnother approach to prevention includes giving entire communities medicine that kills the microscopic worms -- and controlling mosquitoes. Annual mass treatment reduces the level of microfilariae in the blood and thus, diminishes transmission of infection. This is the basis of the global campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.\n   \nExperts consider that lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD), can be eradicated and a global campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem is under way. The elimination strategy is based on annual treatment of whole communities with combinations of drugs that kill the microfilariae. As a result of the generous contributions of these drugs by the companies that make them, tens of millions of people are being treated each year. Since these drugs also reduce levels of infection with intestinal worms, benefits of treatment extend beyond lymphatic filariasis. Successful campaigns to eliminate lymphatic filariasis have taken place in China and other countries.\n   \nMore on: Insect Bite Prevention"

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Lice - Head Lice? ?",
            "answer": "In the United States, infestation with head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers. Head lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection of the skin resulting from scratching can occur with any lice infestation.\n    \nGetting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment.\n    \nHead lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. Such contact can be common among children during play at:\n    \n     - school,\n     - home, and\n     - elsewhere (e.g., sports activities, playgrounds, camp, and slumber parties).\n    \n    \nUncommonly, transmission may occur by:\n    \n     - wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person;\n     - using infested combs, brushes or towels; or\n     - lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person.\n    \n    \nReliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.\n    \nIn the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African-Americans than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair but not others."

            "answer": "Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. The diagnosis of head lice infestation is best made by finding a live nymph or adult louse on the scalp or hair of a person.\n    \nBecause adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. Use of a fine-toothed louse comb may facilitate identification of live lice.\n    \nIf crawling lice are not seen, finding nits attached firmly within \u00bc inch of the base of hair shafts suggests, but does not confirm, the person is infested. Nits frequently are seen on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than \u00bc inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always non-viable (hatched or dead). Head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, although use of a magnifying lens may be necessary to find crawling lice or to identify a developing nymph inside a viable nit. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.\n    \nIf no nymphs or adults are seen, and the only nits found are more than \u00bc inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and no longer active \u2014 and does not need to be treated."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Parasites - Lice - Head Lice ?",
            "answer": "General Guidelines \n   \nTreatment for head lice is recommended for persons diagnosed with an active infestation. All household members and other close contacts should be checked; those persons with evidence of an active infestation should be treated. Some experts believe prophylactic treatment is prudent for persons who share the same bed with actively-infested individuals. All infested persons (household members and close contacts) and their bedmates should be treated at the same time. \n   \nSome pediculicides (medicines that kill lice) have an ovicidal effect (kill eggs). For pediculicides that are only weakly ovicidal or not ovicidal, routine retreatment is recommended. For those that are more strongly ovicidal, retreatment is recommended only if live (crawling) lice are still present several days after treatment (see recommendation for each medication). To be most effective, retreatment should occur after all eggs have hatched but before new eggs are produced. \n   \nWhen treating head lice, supplemental measures can be combined with recommended medicine (pharmacologic treatment); however, such additional (non-pharmacologic) measures generally are not required to eliminate a head lice infestation. For example, hats, scarves, pillow cases, bedding, clothing, and towels worn or used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before treatment is started can be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot air cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5\u00b0C (128.3\u00b0F). Items that cannot be laundered may be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks. Items such as hats, grooming aids, and towels that come in contact with the hair of an infested person should not be shared. Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove an infested person's hairs that might have viable nits attached. \n     \n   \nTreatment of the infested person(s): Requires using an Over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication. Follow these treatment steps: \n    \n    - Before applying treatment, it may be helpful to remove clothing that can become wet or stained during treatment. \n    - Apply lice medicine, also called pediculicide, according to the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. If the infested person has very long hair (longer than shoulder length), it may be necessary to use a second bottle. Pay special attention to instructions on the label or in the box regarding how long the medication should be left on the hair and how it should be washed out.\n \n       \n       \n        \n       \n       \n    - Have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. \n    - If a few live lice are still found 8\u201312 hours after treatment, but are moving more slowly than before, do not retreat. The medicine may take longer to kill all the lice. Comb dead and any remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine\u2013toothed nit comb. \n    - If, after 8\u201312 hours of treatment, no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before, the medicine may not be working. Do not retreat until speaking with your health care provider; a different pediculicide may be necessary. If your health care provider recommends a different pediculicide, carefully follow the treatment instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. \n    - Nit (head lice egg) combs, often found in lice medicine packages, should be used to comb nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. \n    - After each treatment, checking the hair and combing with a nit comb to remove nits and lice every 2\u20133 days may decrease the chance of self\u2013reinfestation. Continue to check for 2\u20133 weeks to be sure all lice and nits are gone. Nit removal is not needed when treating with spinosad topical suspension. \n    - Retreatment is meant to kill any surviving hatched lice before they produce new eggs. For some drugs, retreatment is recommended routinely about a week after the first treatment (7\u20139 days, depending on the drug) and for others only if crawling lice are seen during this period. Retreatment with lindane shampoo is not recommended. \n    \n     \n   \nSupplemental Measures: Head lice do not survive long if they fall off a person and cannot feed. You don't need to spend a lot of time or money on housecleaning activities. Follow these steps to help avoid re\u2013infestation by lice that have recently fallen off the hair or crawled onto clothing or furniture. \n    \n    -  \nMachine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that the infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130\u00b0F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry\u2013cleaned \nOR \nsealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.  \n    - Soak combs and brushes in hot water (at least 130\u00b0F) for 5\u201310 minutes. \n    - Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug or carpet or furniture is very low. Head lice survive less than 1\u20132 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the human scalp. Spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing. \n    - Do not use fumigant sprays; they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. \n    \n   \n \n     \n   \nPrevent Reinfestation: \n   \nMore on: Prevention & Control \n   \n \n     \n   Over-the-counter Medications \n   \nMany head lice medications are available \"over-the-counter\" without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. Each over-the-counter product approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice contains one of the following active ingredients. If crawling lice are still seen after a full course of treatment contact your health care provider. \n    \n    -  \nPyrethrins combined with piperonyl butoxide;\n Brand name products: A\u2013200*, Pronto*, R&C*, Rid*, Triple X*, Licide* \nPyrethrins are naturally occurring pyrethroid extracts from the chrysanthemum flower. Pyrethrins are safe and effective when used as directed. Pyrethrins can only kill live lice, not unhatched eggs (nits). A second treatment is recommended 9 to 10 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Pyrethrins generally should not be used by persons who are allergic to chrysanthemums or ragweed. Pyrethrin is approved for use on children 2 years of age and older.  \n    -  \nPermethrin lotion, 1%;\n Brand name product: Nix*. \nPermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid similar to naturally occurring pyrethrins. Permethrin lotion 1% is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice. Permethrin is safe and effective when used as directed. Permethrin kills live lice but not unhatched eggs. Permethrin may continue to kill newly hatched lice for several days after treatment. A second treatment often is necessary on day 9 to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Permethrin is approved for use on children 2 months of age and older.  \n    \n   \n \n     \n   Prescription Medications \n   \nThe following medications, in alphabetical order, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of head lice are available only by prescription. If crawling lice are still seen after a full course of treatment, contact your health care provider. \n    \n    -  \nBenzyl alcohol lotion, 5%;\n Brand name product: Ulesfia lotion* \nBenzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol. Benzyl alcohol lotion, 5% has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice and is considered safe and effective when used as directed. It kills lice but it is not ovicidal(i.e., does not kill lice eggs). A second treatment is needed 9 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Benzyl alcohol lotion is intended for use on persons who are 6 months of age and older and its safety in persons aged more 60 years has not been established. It can be irritating to the skin.  \n    -  \nIvermectin lotion, 0.5%;\n Brand name product: Sklice* \nIvermectin lotion, 0.5% was approved by the FDA in 2012 for treatment of head lice in persons 6 months of age and older. It is not ovicidal, but appears to prevent nymphs (newly hatched lice) from surviving. It is effective in most patients when given as a single application on dry hair without nit combing. It should not be used for retreatment without talking to a healthcare provider. \nGiven as a tablet in mass drug administrations, oral ivermectin has been used extensively and safely for over two decades in many countries to treat filarial worm infections. Although not FDA-approved for the treatment of lice, ivermectin tablets given in a single oral dose of 200 micrograms/kg repeated in 10 days or 400 micrograms/kg repeated in 7 days has been shown effective against head lice. It should not be used in children weighing less than 15 kg or in pregnant women.   \n    -  \nSpinosad 0.9% topical suspension;\n Brand name product: Natroba* \nSpinosad is derived from soil bacteria. Spinosad topical suspension, 0.9%, was approved by the FDA in 2011. Since it kills live lice as well as unhatched eggs, retreatment is usually not needed. Nit combing is not required. Spinosad topical suspension is approved for the treatment of children 6 months of age and older. It is safe and effective when used as directed. Repeat treatment should be given only if live (crawling) lice are seen 7 days after the first treatment.  \n    \n   \nFor second\u2013line treatment only: \n    \n    -  \nLindane shampoo 1%;\n Brand name products: None available \nLindane is an organochloride. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) no longer recommends it as a pediculocide. Although lindane shampoo 1% is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice, it is not recommended as a first\u2013line treatment. Overuse, misuse, or accidentally swallowing lindane can be toxic to the brain and other parts of the nervous system; its use should be restricted to patients for whom prior treatments have failed or who cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat premature infants, persons with HIV, a seizure disorder, women who are pregnant or breast\u2013feeding, persons who have very irritated skin or sores where the lindane will be applied, infants, children, the elderly, and persons who weigh less than 110 pounds. Retreatment should be avoided.  \n    \n   \n \n   \nWhen treating head lice \n    \n    - Do not use extra amounts of any lice medication unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. The drugs used to treat lice are insecticides and can be dangerous if they are misused or overused. \n    - All the medications listed above should be kept out of the eyes. If they get onto the eyes, they should be immediately flushed away. \n    - Do not treat an infested person more than 2\u20133 times with the same medication if it does not seem to be working. This may be caused by using the medicine incorrectly or by resistance to the medicine. Always seek the advice of your health care provider if this should happen. He/she may recommend an alternative medication. \n    - Do not use different head lice drugs at the same time unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. \n    \n   \n \n   \n*Use of trade names is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection)? ?",
            "answer": "Fascioliasis occurs in many areas of the world and usually is caused by F. hepatica, which is a common liver fluke of sheep and cattle. In general, fascioliasis is more common and widespread in animals than in people. Even so, the number of infected people in the world is thought to exceed 2 million.\n    \nFasciola hepatica is found in more than 50 countries, in all continents except Antarctica. It is found in parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Fasciola gigantica is less widespread. Human cases have been reported in the tropics, in parts of Africa and Asia, and also in Hawaii.\n    \nIn some areas where fascioliasis is found, human cases are uncommon (sporadic). In other areas, human fascioliasis is very common (hyperendemic). For example, the areas with the highest known rates of human infection are in the Andean highlands of Bolivia and Peru.\n    \nSpecial conditions are needed for fascioliasis to be present in an area, and its geographic distribution is very patchy (focal). The eggs passed in the stool of infected mammals have to develop (mature) in a suitable aquatic snail host to be able to infect another mammalian host. Requirements include sufficient moisture and favorable temperatures (above 50\u00b0F) that allow the development of miracidia, reproduction of snails, and larval development within the snails. These factors also contribute to both the prevalence and level (intensity) of infection. Prevalence is highest in areas where climatic conditions promote development of cercariae.\n    \nMore on: Biology\n    \nInfective Fasciola larvae (metacercariae) are found in contaminated water, either stuck to (encysted on) water plants or floating in the water, often in marshy areas, ponds, or flooded pastures. People (and animals) typically become infected by eating raw watercress or other contaminated water plants. The plants may be eaten as a snack or in salads or sandwiches. People also can get infected by ingesting contaminated water, such as by drinking it or by eating vegetables that were washed or irrigated with contaminated water. Infection also can result from eating undercooked sheep or goat livers that contain immature forms of the parasite.\n    \nThe possibility of becoming infected in the United States should be considered, despite the fact that few locally acquired cases have been documented. The prerequisites for the Fasciola life cycle exist in some parts of the United States. In addition, transmission because of imported contaminated produce could occur, as has been documented in Europe."

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) ?",
            "answer": "The standard way to be sure a person is infected with Fasciola is by seeing the parasite. This is usually done by finding Fasciola eggs in stool (fecal) specimens examined under a microscope. More than one specimen may need to be examined to find the parasite. Sometimes eggs are found by examining duodenal contents or bile.\n    \nInfected people don't start passing eggs until they have been infected for several months; people don't pass eggs during the acute phase of the infection. Therefore, early on, the infection has to be diagnosed in other ways than by examining stool. Even during the chronic phase of infection, it can be difficult to find eggs in stool specimens from people who have light infections.\n    \nCertain types of blood tests can be helpful for diagnosing Fasciola infection, including routine blood work and tests that detect antibodies (an immune response) to the parasite.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis"

            "question": "what is botulism?",
            "answer": "Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and sometimes by strains of Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii. There are five main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulinum toxin. Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. Adult intestinal toxemia (adult intestinal colonization) botulism is a very rare kind of botulism that occurs among adults by the same route as infant botulism. Lastly, iatrogenic botulism can occur from accidental overdose of botulinum toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food."

            "answer": "In the United States, an average of 145 cases are reported each year.Of these, approximately 15% are foodborne, 65% are infant botulism, and 20% are wound. Adult intestinal colonization and iatrogenic botulism also occur, but rarely. Outbreaks of foodborne botulism involving two or more persons occur most years and are usually caused by home-canned foods. Most wound botulism cases are associated with black-tar heroin injection, especially in California."

        {
            "question": "what are the symptoms of botulism?",
            "answer": "The classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Infants with botulism appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. These are all symptoms of the muscle paralysis caused by the bacterial toxin. If untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days."

        {
            "question": "how is botulism diagnosed?",
            "answer": "Physicians may consider the diagnosis if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues are usually not enough to allow a diagnosis of botulism. Other diseases such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and special tests may be needed to exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, spinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and a tensilon test for myasthenia gravis. Tests for botulinum toxin and for bacteria that cause botulism can be performed at some state health department laboratories and at CDC."
        },
        {
            "question": "how can botulism be treated?",
            "answer": "The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months, plus intensive medical and nursing care. The paralysis slowly improves. Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism."

        {
            "question": "are there complications from botulism?",
            "answer": "Botulism can result in death due to respiratory failure. However, in the past 50 years the proportion of patients with botulism who die has fallen from about 50% to 3-5%. A patient with severe botulism may require a breathing machine as well as intensive medical and nursing care for several months, and some patients die from infections or other problems related to remaining paralyzed for weeks or months. Patients who survive an episode of botulism poisoning may have fatigue and shortness of breath for years and long-term therapy may be needed to aid recovery."

        {
            "question": "how can botulism be prevented?",
            "answer": "Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older."

            "question": "what are public health agencies doing to prevent or control botulism?",
            "answer": "Public education about botulism prevention is an ongoing activity. Information about safe canning is widely available for consumers. Persons in state health departments and at CDC are knowledgeable about botulism and available to consult with physicians 24 hours a day. If antitoxin is needed to treat a patient, it can be quickly delivered to a physician anywhere in the country. Suspected outbreaks of botulism are quickly investigated, and if they involve a commercial product, the appropriate control measures are coordinated among public health and regulatory agencies. Physicians should immediately report suspected cases of botulism to their state health department.\n                \nFor information and quidelines on canning foods at home: USDA Home Canning Guide"

Although not undertaken at the time of the initial cluster, virus can certainly be isolated from tissue obtained post-mortem if available. A subsequent complete genomic analysis of Chapare virus facilitated the development of specific molecular detection (RT-PCR) assays. \n   \nSerologic diagnosis of CHHF can be made by indirect immunofluorescent assay and ELISA. However, individuals from endemic areas who show fever, dizziness, and myalgia, accompanied by laboratory findings of low white blood cell and platelet counts and excess protein in the urine, should be suspected of having one of the South American hemorrhagic fever viruses.

            "answer": "Angiostrongylus cantonensis\n    \nAngiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as the rat lungworm, is a parasitic nematode (worm) that is transmitted between rats and mollusks (such as slugs or snails) in its natural life cycle. Other animals that become infected such as freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, and planarians of the genus Platydemus, are transport hosts that are not required for reproduction of the parasite but might be able to transmit infection to humans if eaten raw or undercooked. Humans are accidental hosts who do not transmit infection to others. Most cases of infection are diagnosed in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin, but the parasite has also been found in Australia, some areas of Africa, the Caribbean, Hawaii and Louisiana. Outbreaks of human angiostrongyliasis have involved a few to hundreds of persons; over 2,800 cases have been reported in the literature from approximately 30 countries. It is likely that the parasite has been spread by rats transported on ships and by the introduction of mollusks such as the giant African land snail (Achatina fulica). In addition, the semi-slug, Parmarion martensi (native of Southeast Asia)has spread in regions of Hawaii and is found to often be infected with A. cantonensis, and the freshwater snail Pomacea canaliculata (native of South America) has been introduced into Taiwan and China and has been implicated in outbreaks of disease in those countries.\n    \nRisk factors for infection with A. cantonensis include the ingestion of raw or undercooked infected snails or slugs; or pieces of snails and slugs accidentally chopped up in vegetables, vegetable juices, or salads; or foods contaminated by the slime of infected snails or slugs. It is possible that ingestion of raw or undercooked transport hosts (freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, etc. ) can result in human infection, though this is less certain. In addition, contamination of the hands during the preparation of uncooked infected snails or slugs could lead to ingestion of the parasite.\n    \n     \n    Angiostrongylus costaricensis\n    \nAngiostrongylus costaricensis is a parasitic nematode (worm) that resides in rodents and uses mollusks, such as slugs, as an intermediate host. Rats, such as the cotton rat, transmit the larvae through their feces. Slugs then ingest the larvae. Humans are accidental hosts of the parasite. The parasite is not able to complete its life cycle in humans and eventually dies in the abdomen. Human infection principally occurs in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a few cases suspected in the United States and in the Republic of Congo. The organism is also found in animals in the Southern U.S. (Texas).\n    \nRisk factors for infection with A. costaricensis are not well established but are likely to be ingestion of infected slugs or raw vegetables or vegetable juices contaminated with slugs or their slime, which can contain A. costaricensis larvae. The infection of transport hosts, which are not essential to the lifecycle of the parasite, has not been identified and any role in human infection is not known, in contrast to A. cantonensis. Some reports have shown the case rate to be higher in children 6 to 12 years of age, males, and in persons of higher socioeconomic status. There has been one food-related outbreak in Guatemala that affected primarily adults."

However, avoiding fruit bats, and sick non-human primates in central Africa, is one way to protect against infection. \n \nMeasures for prevention of secondary, or person-to-person, transmission are similar to those used for other hemorrhagic fevers. If a patient is either suspected or confirmed to have Marburg hemorrhagic fever, barrier nursing techniques should be used to prevent direct physical contact with the patient. These precautions include wearing of protective gowns, gloves, and masks; placing the infected individual in strict isolation; and sterilization or proper disposal of needles, equipment, and patient excretions. \n \nIn conjunction with the World Health Organization, CDC has developed practical, hospital-based guidelines, titled: Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers In the African Health Care Setting. The manual can help health-care facilities recognize cases and prevent further hospital-based disease transmission using locally available materials and few financial resources. \n \nMarburg hemorrhagic fever is a very rare human disease. However, when it occurs, it has the potential to spread to other people, especially health care staff and family members who care for the patient. Therefore, increasing awareness in communities and among health-care providers of the clinical symptoms of patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever is critical. Better awareness can lead to earlier and stronger precautions against the spread of Marburg virus in both family members and health-care providers. Improving the use of diagnostic tools is another priority.

A tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop RMSF do not remember being bitten. The disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. Because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of RMSF is made and correct treatment begins.

It is important for physicians to consider RMSF if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present. \n                \nA classic case of RMSF involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles.  Often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed. \n                \nThe red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop. \n                \nFigure 1a and 1b: Examples of an early-stage rash in an RMSF patient. \n \n  \n   \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \n                \n  \n \n                \n \nLong-term Health Problems \n                \nPatients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. Rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. The damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a \"vasculitis\", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. Loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. Patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. Those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months. \n                \n \nInfection in Children \n                \nChildren with RMSF infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with RMSF are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. Occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis. \n                \nFor more in-depth information about signs and symptoms of RMSF, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nPhysician Diagnosis \n                \nThere are several aspects of RMSF that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. The symptoms of RMSF vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. Treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. Due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment. \n                \nFor this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient\u2019s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. The healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of RMSF but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of RMSF. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n                \n \nLaboratory Confirmation \n                \nR. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. For this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. If the patient has a rash, PCR or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. This test can often deliver a rapid result. These tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. PCR, culture, and IHC can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. Culture of R. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect R. rickettsii. \n                \nDuring RMSF infection, a patient\u2019s immune system develops antibodies to R. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out RMSF as a cause of illness. \n                \nThe gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of RMSF is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with R. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most RMSF cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. \n                \nBoth IgM and IgG levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. Up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to R. rickettsii or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of RMSF. For more in-depth information about testing, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nTreatment \n                \nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever RMSF is suspected.  \n                \nUse of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. Treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop. \n                \nIf the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient\u2019s condition might not be RMSF. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented. \n                \nRecommended Dosage\nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: \n \n - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours \n - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day \n \n                \nPatients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days. \nTreating Children \n                \nThe use of doxycycline to treat suspected RMSF in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. Unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat RMSF has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages. \nOther Treatments \n                \nIn cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of RMSF appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. Oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the United States, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and Grey baby syndrome. Furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against R. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection. \nProphylaxis (Preventive Treatment) \n                \nAntibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent RMSF. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop. \n                \nFor more in-depth information about treatment, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nOther Considerations \n                \nThe clinical presentation for RMSF can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Similar to RMSF, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

CE is found in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America, and in rare cases, North America. The parasite is transmitted to dogs when they ingest the organs of other animals that contain hydatid cysts. The cysts develop into adult tapeworms in the dog. Infected dogs shed tapeworm eggs in their feces which contaminate the ground. Sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs ingest tapeworm eggs in the contaminated ground; once ingested, the eggs hatch and develop into cysts in the internal organs. The most common mode of transmission to humans is by the accidental consumption of soil, water, or food that has been contaminated by the fecal matter of an infected dog. Echinococcus eggs that have been deposited in soil can stay viable for up to a year. The disease is most commonly found in people involved in raising sheep, as a result of the sheep's role as an intermediate host of the parasite and the presence of working dogs that are allowed to eat the offal of infected sheep.\n    \nAlveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis.

Contact can be direct or through inhalation of aerosolized Lujo virus from the urine or feces of infected rodents. \n \nPerson-to-person transmission of Lujo virus was observed in the small, nosocomial cluster of hemorrhagic disease which resulted in the discovery of the Lujo virus. \n \nTransmission of arenaviruses, and Lujo virus in particular, is most likely the result of direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person, in the absence of infection control precautions."

            "answer": "The symptoms of Lujo hemorrhagic fever, as described in the five patients in the original cluster outbreak, resemble those of severe Lassa Fever. After an incubation period of 7 to 13 days, the clinical course started by a non-specific febrile illness accompanied by headache and muscle pain. \n                \nThe disease increases in severity, with: \n \n - a morbilliform rash of the face and trunk \n - face and neck swelling \n - pharyngitis (sore throat) \n - diarrhea \n \n                \nBleeding was not a prominent feature during the illness. \n                \nIn the fatal cases (4/5 patients), a transient improvement was followed by: \n \n - rapid deterioration with respiratory distress \n - neurological signs and circulatory collapse \n \n                \nDeath occurred 10 to 13 days after onset. \n                \nLow blood platelets, low white blood cell count (at the onset, rising later on) and elevated liver function values were present in all patients. \n                \nSince Arenaviruses may enter the fetus through infection of the mother, and anectodal evidence suggests that infected pregnant women may suffer miscarriages, it is reasonable to assume that both infection of the fetus and miscarriage may be associated with Lujo infection in the mother."

A subsequent complete genomic analysis of Lujo virus facilitated the development of specific molecular detection (RT-PCR) assays. \n   \nSerologic diagnosis of Lujo hemorrhagic fever can be made by indirect immunofluorescent assay and ELISA. However, individuals from endemic areas displaying fever, rash, pharyngitis, accompanied by laboratory findings of low platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes, should be suspected of having a hemorrhagic fever virus infection. Clinical specimens should be tested using specific assays."

            "answer": "Infected dogs and cats shed Toxocara eggs in their feces into the environment. Once in the environment, it takes 2 to 4 weeks for Toxocara larvae to develop and for the eggs to become infectious. Humans or other animals can be infected by accidentally ingesting Toxocara eggs. For example, humans can become infected if they work with dirt and accidentally ingest dirt containing Toxocara eggs. Although rare, people can be infected by eating undercooked or raw meat from an infected animal such as a lamb or rabbit. Because dogs and cats are frequently found where people live, there may be large numbers of infected eggs in the environment. Once in the body, the Toxocara eggs hatch and roundworm larvae can travel in the bloodstream to different parts of the body, including the liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscles, or eyes. Most infected people do not have any symptoms. However, in some people, the Toxocara larvae can cause damage to these tissues and organs. The symptoms of toxocariasis, the disease caused by these migrating larvae, include fever, coughing, inflammation of the liver, or eye problems.\n    \nA U.S. study in 1996 showed that 30% of dogs younger than 6 months deposit Toxocara eggs in their feces; other studies have shown that almost all puppies are born already infected with Toxocara canis. Research also suggests that 25% of all cats are infected with Toxocara cati. Infection rates are higher for dogs and cats that are left outside for more time and allowed to eat other animals. In humans, it has been found that almost 14% of the U.S. population has been infected with Toxocara. Globally, toxocariasis is found in many countries, and prevalence rates can reach as high as 40% or more in parts of the world. There are several factors that have been associated with higher rates of infection with Toxocara. People are more likely to be infected with Toxocara if they own a dog. Children and adolescents under the age of 20 are more likely to test positive for Toxocara infection. This may be because children are more likely to eat dirt and play in outdoor environments, such as sandboxes, where dog and cat feces can be found. This infection is more common in people living in poverty. Geographic location plays a role as well, because Toxocara is more prevalent in hot, humid regions where eggs are kept viable in the soil."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Enterobiasis (also known as Pinworm Infection)? ?",
            "answer": "Risk Factors\n    \nThe people most likely to be infected with pinworm are children under 18, people who take care of infected children and people who are institutionalized. In these groups, the prevalence can reach 50%.\n    \nPinworm is the most common worm infection in the United States. Humans are the only species that can transfer this parasite. Household pets like dogs and cats cannot become infected with human pinworms. Pinworm eggs can survive in the indoor environment for 2 to 3 weeks.\n    Epidemiology\n    \nPinworm infections are more common within families with school-aged children, in primary caregivers of infected children, and in institutionalized children.\n    \nA person is infected with pinworms by ingesting pinworm eggs either directly or indirectly. These eggs are deposited around the anus by the worm and can be carried to common surfaces such as hands, toys, bedding, clothing, and toilet seats. By putting anyone\u2019s contaminated hands (including one\u2019s own) around the mouth area or putting one\u2019s mouth on common contaminated surfaces, a person can ingest pinworm eggs and become infected with the pinworm parasite. Since pinworm eggs are so small, it is possible to ingest them while breathing.\n    \nOnce someone has ingested pinworm eggs, there is an incubation period of 1 to 2 months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine. Once mature, the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night, when many of their hosts are asleep. People who are infected with pinworm can transfer the parasite to others for as long as there is a female pinworm depositing eggs on the perianal skin. A person can also re-infect themselves, or be re-infected by eggs from another person."

            "answer": "A person infected with pinworm is often asymptomatic, but itching around the anus is a common symptom. Diagnosis of pinworm can be reached from three simple techniques. The first option is to look for the worms in the perianal reqion 2 to 3 hours after the infected person is asleep. The second option is to touch the perianal skin with transparent tape to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus first thing in the morning. If a person is infected, the eggs on the tape will be visible under a microscope. The tape method should be conducted on 3 consecutive mornings right after the infected person wakes up and before he/she does any washing. Since anal itching is a common symptom of pinworm, the third option for diagnosis is analyzing samples from under fingernails under a microscope. An infected person who has scratched the anal area may have picked up some pinworm eggs under the nails that could be used for diagnosis.\n    \nSince pinworm eggs and worms are often sparse in stool, examining stool samples is not recommended. Serologic tests are not available for diagnosing pinworm infections."

All three of these drugs are to be given in 1 dose at first and then another single dose 2 weeks later. Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription. The medication does not reliably kill pinworm eggs. Therefore, the second dose is to prevent re-infection by adult worms that hatch from any eggs not killed by the first treatment.Health practitioners and parents should weigh the health risks and benefits of these drugs for patients under 2 years of age.\n    \nRepeated infections should be treated by the same method as the first infection. In households where more than one member is infected or where repeated, symptomatic infections occur, it is recommended that all household members be treated at the same time. In institutions, mass and simultaneous treatment, repeated in 2 weeks, can be effective."

In order to stop the spread of pinworm and possible re-infection, people who are infected should bathe every morning to help remove a large amount of the eggs on the skin. Showering is a better method than taking a bath, because showering avoids potentially contaminating the bath water with pinworm eggs. Infected people should not co-bathe with others during their time of infection.\n    \nAlso, infected people should comply with good hygiene practices such as washing their hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. They should also cut fingernails regularly, and avoid biting the nails and scratching around the anus. Frequent changing of underclothes and bed linens first thing in the morning is a great way to prevent possible transmission of eggs in the environment and risk of reinfection. These items should not be shaken and carefully placed into a washer and laundered in hot water followed by a hot dryer to kill any eggs that may be there.\n    \nIn institutions, day care centers, and schools, control of pinworm can be difficult, but mass drug administration during an outbreak can be successful.

            "question": "How to diagnose Tuberculosis (TB) ?",
            "answer": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is spread through the air from one person to another. There are two kinds of tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: the tuberculin skin test and TB blood tests. \n  \nA positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease. \n  \nTuberculin skin test: The TB skin test (also called the Mantoux tuberculin skin test) is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin in the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm. The health care worker will look for a raised, hard area or swelling, and if present, measure its size using a ruler. Redness by itself is not considered part of the reaction. \n  \nThe skin test result depends on the size of the raised, hard area or swelling. It also depends on the person\u2019s risk of being infected with TB bacteria and the progression to TB disease if infected. \n   \n   - Positive skin test: This \n     means the person\u2019s body was infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. \n   - Negative skin test: This means the person\u2019s body did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. \n   \n  \n \n     TB blood tests: \n    TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. An IGRA measures how strong a person\u2019s immune system reacts to TB bacteria by testing the person\u2019s blood in a laboratory. \n  \nTwo IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: \n   \n   - QuantiFERON\u00ae\u2013TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) \n   - T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (T-Spot) \n   \n   \n   - Positive IGRA: This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. \n   - Negative IGRA: This means that the person\u2019s blood did not react to the test and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. \n   \n  \nIGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for the following: \n    \n   - People who have a difficult time returning for a second appointment to look for a reaction to the TST. \n   \n  \nThere is no problem with repeated IGRAs. \n    \n   \n   \n     Testing for TB in BCG-Vaccinated Persons \n  \nMany people born outside of the United States have been BCG-vaccinated. \n  \nPeople who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. \n  \nIGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false-positive result in people who have received BCG. \n   \n     Choosing a TB Test \n  \nThe person\u2019s health care provider should choose which TB test to use. Factors in selecting which test to use include the reason for testing, test availability, and cost. Generally, it is not recommended to test a person with both a TST and an IGRA. \n   \n     Diagnosis of Latent TB Infection or TB Disease \n  \nIf a person is found to be infected with TB bacteria, other tests are needed to see if the person has TB disease. \n  \nTB disease can be diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests. TB disease is treated by taking several drugs as recommended by a health care provider. \n  \nIf a person does not have TB disease, but has TB bacteria in the body, then latent TB infection is diagnosed. The decision about treatment for latent TB infection will be based on a person\u2019s chances of developing TB disease. \n   \n     Diagnosis of TB Disease \n  \nPeople suspected of having TB disease should be referred for a medical evaluation, which will include \n   \n   - Medical history, \n   - Physical examination, \n   - Test for TB infection (TB skin test or TB blood test), \n   - Chest radiograph (X-ray), and \n   - Appropriate laboratory tests \n   \n  \nSee Diagnosis of TB (Fact sheet) for more information about TB diagnosis. \n   \n    \n      Related Links \n     \n    \n   For Patients \n        \n    \n   For Health Care Providers"

They should ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.\n  \nTravelers who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to people with TB (for example, those who expect to come in contact routinely with clinic, hospital, prison, or homeless shelter populations) should have a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test before leaving the United States. If the test reaction is negative, they should have a repeat test 8 to 10 weeks after returning to the United States. Additionally, annual testing may be recommended for those who anticipate repeated or prolonged exposure or an extended stay over a period of years.

The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal.\n  \nNot everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent TB infection and TB disease. Both latent TB infection and TB disease can be treated. Learn more about the difference between latent TB infection and TB disease.\n  \n     Treatment for Latent TB Infection\n  \nPeople with latent TB infection have TB bacteria in their bodies, but they are not sick because the bacteria are not active. People with latent TB infection do not have symptoms, and they cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if TB bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent TB infection to being sick with TB disease. For this reason, people with latent TB infection are often prescribed treatment to prevent them from developing TB disease. Treatment of latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB in the United States.\n  \nBecause there are less bacteria in a person with latent TB infection, treatment is much easier. Four regimens are approved for the treatment of latent TB infection. The medications used to treat latent TB infection include:\n  \n   - isoniazid (INH)\n   - rifampin (RIF)\n   - rifapentine (RPT)\n  \n  \nCertain groups of people (such as people with weakened immune systems) are at very high risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB bacteria. Every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent TB infection.\n  \nMore: Treatment for Latent TB Infection\n  \n     Treatment for TB Disease\n  \nTB bacteria become active (multiplying in the body) if the immune system can't stop them from growing. When TB bacteria are active, this is called TB disease. TB disease will make a person sick. People with TB disease may spread the bacteria to people with whom they spend many hours.\n  \nTB disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. There are 10 drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating TB. Of the approved drugs, the first-line anti-TB agents that form the core of treatment regimens include:\n  \n   - isoniazid (INH)\n   - rifampin (RIF)\n   - ethambutol (EMB)\n   - pyrazinamide (PZA)\n  \n  \nRegimens for treating TB disease have an initial phase of 2 months, followed by a choice of several options for the continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months (total of 6 to 9 months for treatment). Learn more about the continuation phase of treatment.\n  \nIt is very important that people who have TB disease finish the medicine, taking the drugs exactly as prescribed. If they stop taking the drugs too soon, they can become sick again; if they do not take the drugs correctly, the TB bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat.\n  \nMore: Treatment for TB Disease\n  \n     Treatment Completion\n  \nTreatment completion is determined by the number of doses ingested over a given period of time.

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Cysticercosis? ?",
            "answer": "Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the tapeworm, Taenia solium. A person with an adult tapeworm, which lives in the person\u2019s gut, sheds eggs in the stool.  The infection with the adult tapeworm is called taeniasis.  A pig then eats the eggs in the stool.  The eggs develop into larvae inside the pig and form cysts (called cysticerci) in the pig's muscles or other tissues. The infection with the cysts is called cysticercosis. Humans who eat undercooked or raw infected pork swallow the cysts in the meat. The larvae then come out of their cysts in the human gut and develop into adult tapeworms, completing the cycle.\n    \nPeople get cysticercosis when they swallow eggs that are excreted in the stool of people with the adult tapeworm. This may happen when people\n    \n     - Drink water or eat food contaminated with tapeworm eggs\n     - Put contaminated fingers in their mouth\n    \n    \nCysticercosis is not spread by eating undercooked meat. However, people get infected with tapeworms (taeniasis) by eating undercooked infected pork. People who have tapeworm infections can infect themselves with the eggs and develop cysticercosis (this is called autoinfection). They can also infect other people if they have poor hygiene and contaminate food or water that other people swallow. People who live with someone who has a tapeworm infection in their intestines have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than other people.\n    \nHuman cysticercosis is found worldwide, especially in areas where pig cysticercosis is common. Both taeniasis and cysticercosis are most often found in rural areas of developing countries with poor sanitation, where pigs roam freely and eat human feces. Taeniasis and cysticercosis are rare among persons who live in countries where pigs are not raised and in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces. Although uncommon, cysticercosis can occur in people who have never traveled outside of the United States if they are exposed to tapeworm eggs.\n    \nMore on: Taeniasis"

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Ehrlichiosis ?",
            "answer": "Symptoms  \n                \nIn the United States, the term \u201cehrlichiosis\u201d may be broadly applied to several different infections. Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are transmitted by the lonestar tick in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In addition, a third Ehrlichia species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML) has been identified in a small number of patients residing in or traveling to Minnesota and Wisconsin; a tick vector for the EML organism has not yet been established. The symptoms caused by infection with these Ehrlichia species usually develop 1-2 weeks after being bitten by an infected tick.  The tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick.  \n                \n The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. \n \n - Fever \n - Headache \n - Chills \n - Malaise \n - Muscle pain \n - Nausea / Vomiting / Diarrhea \n - Confusion \n - Conjunctival injection (red eyes) \n - Rash (in up to 60% of children, less than 30% of adults) \n \n                \nEhrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.  \n                \n \nRash \n                \nSkin rash is not considered a common feature of ehrlichiosis, and should not be used to rule in or rule out an infection. Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection can cause a rash in up to 60% of children, but is reported in fewer than 30% of adults. Rash is not commonly reported in patients infected with Ehrlichia ewingii or the Ehrlichia muris-like organism.  The rash associated with Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range from maculopapular to petechial in nature, and is usually not pruritic (itchy). The rash usually spares the face, but in some cases may spread to the palms and soles.  A type of rash called erythroderma may develop in some patients.  Erythroderma is a type of rash that resembles a sunburn and consists of widespread reddening of the skin that may peel after several days.  Some patients may develop a rash that resembles the rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever making these two diseases difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical signs alone. \n                \n \nImmune-compromised Individuals \n                \nThe severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids , cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and may also have higher case-fatality rates (i.e. the proportion of patients that die from infection.)   \n                \n \nBlood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Ehrlichia species \n                \nBecause Ehrlichia organisms infect the white blood cells and circulate in the blood stream, these pathogens may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Ehrlichia chaffeensis has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected E. chaffeensis transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although to date no cases have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission. Patients who develop ehrlichiosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens. However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood; therefore, this process may not eliminate the risk completely. \n                \nFor more in-depth information about signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nDiagnosis \n                \n  \n                \nThe diagnosis of ehrlichiosis must be made based on clinical signs and symptoms, and can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests.  Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result.  \nPhysician Diagnosis \n                \nThere are several aspects of ehrlichiosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently be negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. \n                \nFor this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient\u2019s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where ehrlichiosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of ehrlichiosis, but may not be present in all patients depending on the course of the disease.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. \n                \n \nLaboratory Detection \n                \nDuring the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has ehrlichiosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis. \n                \nDuring the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients. \n \n   \n  \n \n                \nThe type of blood cell in which morulae are observed may provide insight into the infecting species: E. chaffeensis most commonly infects monocytes, whereas E. ewingii more commonly infect granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of Ehrlichia is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect Ehrlichia. \n                \nWhen a person develops ehrlichiosis, their immune system produces antibodies to the Ehrlichia, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out ehrlichiosis as a cause of illness.  \n                \nThe gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using E. chaffeensis antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of ehrlichiosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or \u201cnegative,\u201d and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. \n                \nSerologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results.  \n                \nAntibodies to E. chaffeensis may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Up to 12% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to Ehrlichia species or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of ehrlichiosis.  \n                \nFor more in-depth information about the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nTreatment \n                \nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever ehrlichiosis is suspected.  \n                \nUse of antibiotics other than doxycycline and other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. \n                \nIf the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient\u2019s condition might not be due to ehrlichiosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  \n                \nRecommended Dosage \n                \nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: \n \n - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours \n - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day \n \n                \nPatients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days.  Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. \n                \n \nTreating children \n                \nThe use of doxycycline to treat suspected ehrlichiosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat ehrlichiosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected ehrlichiosis in patients of all ages.  \n                \n \nOther Treatments \n                \nIn cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of ehrlichiosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of either ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin appears effective against Ehrlichia in laboratory settings. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with ehrlichiosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against ehrlichiosis, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  \n                \n \nProphylaxis (Preventive Treatment) \n                \nAntibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent ehrlichiosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.  \n                \nFor more in-depth information about treatment, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n                \n \nOther Considerations \n                \nThe clinical presentation for ehrlichiosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and anaplasmosis. Similar to ehrlichiosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

The mites in crusted scabies are not more virulent than in non-crusted scabies; however, they are much more numerous (up to 2 million per patient). Because they are infested with such large numbers of mites, persons with crusted scabies are very contagious to other persons. In addition to spreading scabies through brief direct skin-to-skin contact, persons with crusted scabies can transmit scabies indirectly by shedding mites that contaminate items such as their clothing, bedding, and furniture. Persons with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent outbreaks of scabies."

Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. \n  \nUse of insecticide sprays and fumigants is not recommended. \n    \n  Medications Used to Treat Scabies \n  \n    \n   \n  \nProducts used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor\u2019s prescription. No \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat scabies. \n  \nScabicide should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as well as the rest of their body. The scabicide should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. \n  \nThe instructions contained in the box or printed on the label always should be followed carefully. Always contact a doctor or pharmacist if unsure how to use a particular medicine. \n  \nBecause the symptoms of scabies are due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces (scybala), itching still may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. If itching still is present more than 2 to 4 weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash lesions continue to appear, retreatment may be necessary. \n  \nSkin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor."

            "question": "How to prevent Parasites - Scabies ?",
            "answer": "When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.\n    \nScabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\n    \nPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\n    \nRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use. Environmental disinfestation using pesticide sprays or fogs generally is unnecessary and is discouraged."

            "answer": "Prevention\n    \nNo vaccine is available.\n    \nThe best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:\n    \n     - Avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. Swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.\n     - Drink safe water. Although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. Because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. Bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. Iodine treatment alone WILL NOT GUARANTEE that water is safe and free of all parasites.\n     - Water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.\n     - Vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. However, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.\n    \n    \nThose who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.\n    \nMore on: Schistosomiasis in Travelers\n   \n  \n  \n   Control\n   \nIn countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:\n   \n    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or\n    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite\u2019s life cycle.\n   \n   \nFor all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. In some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a \"winnable battle\" by public health officials.\n   \nControl measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. Some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:\n   \n    - Chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.\n    - For certain species of the parasite, such as S. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. Runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources."

People with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. People who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. People with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous (IV) catheters. People who are colonized with VRE. Top of page What is the treatment for VRE? People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Top of page How can patients prevent the spread of VRE? If a patient or someone in their household has VRE, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of VRE: Keep their hands clean. Always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean their hands after contact with persons who have VRE. Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others. Top of page What should patients do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Anyone who thinks they have VRE must talk with their healthcare provider.

            "question": "How to prevent Eastern Equine Encephalitis ?",
            "answer": "There is no vaccine against Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) for humans. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes is the best defense against infection with EEEV and other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. \n   \n   -  Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. The repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow the directions on the package.  \n   -  Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.  \n   -  Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  \n   -  Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.  \n"

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Q Fever ?",
            "answer": "Q fever can cause acute or chronic illness in humans, who usually acquire infection after contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated environments. The acute symptoms caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected withC. burnetii do not show symptoms. \n \nThe following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever. However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. \n  \n  - high fevers (up to 104-105\u00b0F)  \n  - severe headache  \n  - general malaise  \n  - myalgia  \n  - chills and/or sweats  \n  - non-productive cough  \n  - nausea  \n  - vomiting  \n  - diarrhea  \n  - abdominal pain  \n  - chest pain  \n  \n \nAlthough most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue) and central nervous system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is low,  at < 2% of hospitalized patients. Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of illness for acute Q fever.  \n \nChronic Q fever is a severe disease occurring in <5% of acutely infected patients. It may present soon (within 6 weeks) after an acute infection, or may manifest years later.  The three groups at highest risk for chronic Q fever are pregnant women, immunosuppressed persons and patients with a pre-existing heart valve defects. Endocarditis is the major form of chronic disease, comprising 60-70% of all reported cases. The estimated case fatality rate in untreated patients with endocarditis is 25-60%. Patients with endocarditis require early diagnosis and long-term antibiotic treatment (at least 18 months) for a successful outcome.   Other forms of chronic Q fever include aortic aneurysms and infections of the bone, liver or reproductive organs, such as the testes in males. \n \nCoxiella burnetii has the ability to persist for long periods of time in the host after infection. Although the majority of people with acute Q fever recover completely, a post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported to occur in 10-25% of some acute patients. This syndrome is characterized by constant or recurring fatigue, night sweats, severe headaches, photophobia (eye sensitivity to light), pain in muscles and joints, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping.  \n \n \n Physician Diagnosis \n \nThere are several aspects of Q fever that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started in the first three days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness.  For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient\u2019s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent travel to rural or agricultural communities where infected livestock may be present, or employment in high risk occupations such as veterinarians or farmers can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  Chronic Q fever is a risk for anyone with a history of acute Q fever illness, particularly those persons with valvular disease, blood vessel abnormalities, immunosuppressed persons, and women who were pregnant when they became infected.  \n \nThe healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a prolonged fever with low platelet count, normal leukocyte count, and elevated liver enzymes are suggestive of acute Q fever infection, but may not be present in all patients.  After a suspect diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of Q fever. \n \nSuspect diagnosis of Q fever is made based on signs and symptoms and a high index of clinical suspicion.  Diagnosis can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests. Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result. \n \n  \n \n \n Laboratory Confirmation \n \nDuring the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has Q fever. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. PCR or immunohistochemistry of biopsy specimens has also been used to diagnose Q fever. These tests may be appropriate for endocarditis patients undergoing valve replacement surgery or patients with hepatitis. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be withheld due to a negative result. Culture isolation of C. burnetii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism.  \n \nWhen a person develops Q fever, their immune system produces antibodies to C. burnetii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out Q fever as a cause of illness. There are two distinct antigenic phases to which humans develop antibody responses. In acute infection, an antibody response to C. burnetii Phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than Phase I antibody response; the reverse is true in chronic infection which is associated with a rising Phase I IgG titer (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800) that is often much higher than Phase II IgG.  The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of acute Q fever is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using C. burnetii antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of Q fever, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or \u201cnegative,\u201d and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians should request both Phase I and Phase II IgG and IgM serologic titers for diagnostic confirmation of acute and chronic Q fever.  Antibodies to C. burnetii may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Approximately 3% of currently healthy people in the U.S. general population and up to 20% of people in high-risk professions (veterinarians, ranchers, etc.) have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to C. burnetii. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret the findings.  \n \nPaired samples taken 2-3 weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of acute Q fever. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever is confirmed by elevated Phase I IgG antibody (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800 and higher than Phase II IgG) and an identifiable persistent focus of infection (e.g. endocarditis).  Elevated Phase I titers alone do not confirm a chronic Q fever diagnosis and would not warrant treatment in a clinically normal patient. Because chronic Q fever involves lengthy persistence of the organism in the body, the antibody levels are often quite high and you will not see a rising titer between paired serum specimens. \n \nFor more in-depth information about the diagnosis of Q fever, please visit http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp \n \n \n Treatment \n \nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for all adults, and for children with severe illness. Treatment should be initiated immediately whenever Q fever is suspected. \n \nUse of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of severe illness. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. \n \nIf the patient is treated within the first 3 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient\u2019s condition might not be due to Q fever. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline has not been documented.  \n \nThere is no role for prophylactic antimicrobial agents in preventing Q fever after a known exposure and prior to symptom onset; attempts at prophylaxis will likely extend the incubation period by several days but will not prevent infection from occurring.  \n \nRecommended Dosage for Acute Q fever\n Doxycycline is the first line treatment for children with severe illness of all ages and adults: \n  \n  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours  \n  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day  \n  \n \nPatients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 2-3 weeks.  \n \nRecommended Dosage for Chronic Q fever \n  \n  - Adults: Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg every 8 hours. \n  \n \nStandard duration of treatment is 18 months. \n \n \n Treating children \n \nThe use of doxycycline is recommended to treat Q fever in children of all ages who are hospitalized or are severely ill. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, doxycycline has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, and most experts consider the benefit of doxycycline in treating Q fever in children younger than 8 years of age with severe illness or who are hospitalized greater than the potential risk of dental staining.  Children with mild illness who are less than 8 years of age may be treated with co-trimoxazole, but therapy should be switched to doxycycline if their course of illness worsens. \n \n \n Other Treatments \n \nIn cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in pregnant patients, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Treatment of pregnant women diagnosed with acute Q fever with once daily co-trimoxazole throughout pregnancy has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of adverse consequences for the fetus."

            "question": "How to prevent Q Fever ?",
            "answer": "In the United States, Q fever outbreaks have resulted mainly from occupational exposure involving veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy workers, livestock farmers, and researchers at facilities housing sheep. Prevention and control efforts should be directed primarily toward these groups and environments. \n \nThe following measures should be used in the prevention and control of Q fever: \n  \n  - Educate the public on sources of infection.  \n  - Appropriately dispose of placenta, birth products, fetal membranes, and aborted fetuses at facilities housing sheep and goats.  \n  - Restrict access to barns and laboratories used in housing potentially infected animals.   \n  - Use appropriate procedures for bagging, autoclaving, and washing of laboratory clothing.  \n  - Vaccinate (where possible) individuals engaged in research with pregnant sheep or live C. burnetii.  \n  - Quarantine imported animals.  \n  - Ensure that holding facilities for sheep should be located away from populated areas. Animals should be routinely tested for antibodies to C. burnetii, and measures should be implemented to prevent airflow to other occupied areas.  \n  - Counsel persons at highest risk for developing chronic Q fever, especially persons with pre-existing cardiac valvular disease or individuals with vascular grafts.  \n  \n \nA vaccine for Q fever has been developed and has successfully protected humans in occupational settings in Australia. However, this vaccine is not commercially available in the United States. Persons wishing to be vaccinated should first have a skin test to determine a history of previous exposure. Individuals who have previously been exposed to C. burnetii should not receive the vaccine because severe reactions, localized to the area of the injected vaccine, may occur. A vaccine for use in animals has also been developed, but it is not available in the United States. \n Significance for Bioterrorism \n \nCoxiella burnetii is a highly infectious agent that is rather resistant to heat and drying. It can become airborne and inhaled by humans. A single C. burnetii organism may cause disease in a susceptible person. This agent has a past history of being developed for use in biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Anaplasmosis ?",
            "answer": "Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilium. This pathogen is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the vector of A. phagocytophilum in the northeast and upper midwestern United States. The western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is the primary vector in Northern California. The first symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1-2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless, and some patients who develop anaplasmosis do not remember being bitten. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease. However, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. \n  \n  - Fever \n  - Headache \n  - Muscle pain \n  - Malaise \n  - Chills \n  - Nausea / Abdominal pain \n  - Cough \n  - Confusion \n  - Rash (rare with anaplasmosis) \n  \n \nAnaplasmosis can be a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, hemorrhage, renal failure or neurological problems. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e., the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is less than 1%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. \n \n \n Rash \n \nRash is rarely reported in patients with anaplasmosis and the presence of a rash may signify that the patient has a coinfection with the pathogen that causes Lyme disease or another tickborne disease, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever . \n \n \n Immune-compromised Individuals \n \nThe severity of anaplasmosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and case-fatality rates for these individuals are characteristically higher than case-fatality rates reported for the general population. \n \n \n Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Anaplasma species \n \nBecause A. phagocytophilum infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream, this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several cases of anaplasmosis have been reported associated with the transfusion of packed red blood cells donated from asymptomatic or acutely infected donors. Patients who develop anaplasmosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens.  However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood. Therefore, while this process may reduce the risk of transmission, it does not eliminate it completely. \n \n \n Physician Diagnosis \n \nThere are several aspects of anaplasmosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. \n \nFor this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient\u2019s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where anaplasmosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of anaplasmosis, but may not be present in all patients.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaplasmosis. \n   \n   \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n Laboratory Detection \n \nDuring the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has anaplasmosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be with held due to a negative result. \n \nDuring the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of anaplasma) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients.  During A. phagocytophilum infection, morulae are most frequently observed in granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of A. phagocytophilum is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism. \n Figure 1: Morulae detected in a granulocyte on a peripheral blood smear, associated with A. phagocytophilum infection. \n  \n   \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \nWhen a person develops anaplasmosis, their immune system produces antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.

In most cases of anaplasmosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or \u201cnegative,\u201d and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. \n \nSerologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results. \n \nAntibodies to A. phagocytophilum may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Between 5-10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to A. phagocytophilum or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of anaplasmosis. \n \nFor more in-depth information about the diagnosis of anaplasmosis, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n \n \n Treatment \n \nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected.  \n \nUse of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines has been associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. \n \nIf the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient\u2019s condition might not be due to anaplasmosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  \n \nRecommended Dosage\nDoxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: \n  \n  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours \n  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day \n  \n \nPatients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days. Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. \n Treating children \n \nThe use of doxycycline to treat suspected anaplasmosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat anaplasmosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages.  \n Other Treatments \n \nIn cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin has been used successfully in several pregnant women with anaplasmosis, and studies suggest that this drug appears effective against Anaplasma species. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with anaplasmosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against A. phagocytophilum, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  \n Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment) \n \nAntibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent anaplasmosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.  \n \nFor more in-depth information about treatment, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm \n \n \n Other Considerations \n \nThe clinical presentation for anaplasmosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and ehrlichiosis. Similar to anaplasmosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection)? ?",
            "answer": "People become infected with Cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts, which are the infective form of the parasite. This most commonly occurs when food or water contaminated with feces is consumed. An infected person sheds unsporulated (immature, non-infective) Cyclospora oocysts in the feces. The oocysts are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate (become infective). Therefore, direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely, as is transmission via ingestion of newly contaminated food or water.\n    \nMore on: Cyclospora Biology\n    Geographic Distribution\n    \nCyclosporiasis occurs in many countries, but it seems to be most common in tropical and subtropical regions. In areas where cyclosporiasis has been studied, the risk for infection is seasonal. However, no consistent pattern has been identified regarding the time of year or the environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall.\n    \nIn the United States, foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis since the mid-1990s have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce; no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated.\n    \nU.S. cases of infection also have occurred in persons who traveled to Cyclospora-endemic areas. To reduce the risk for infection, travelers should take precautions, such as those recommended in CDC's Health Information for International Travel (Yellow Book). Travelers also should be aware that treatment of water or food with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill Cyclospora oocysts."

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?",
            "answer": "Clinical Diagnosis\n    \nHealth care providers should consider Cyclospora as a potential cause of prolonged diarrheal illness, particularly in patients with a history of recent travel to Cyclospora-endemic areas. Testing for Cyclospora is not routinely done in most U.S. laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Therefore, if indicated, health care providers should specifically request testing for Cyclospora.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis\n    Laboratory Diagnosis\n    \nCyclospora infection is diagnosed by examining stool specimens. Diagnosis can be difficult in part because even persons who are symptomatic might not shed enough oocysts in their stool to be readily detectable by laboratory examinations. Therefore, patients might need to submit several specimens collected on different days.\n    \nSpecial techniques, such as acid-fast staining, are often used to make Cyclospora oocysts more visible under the microscope. In addition, Cyclospora oocysts are autofluorescent, meaning that when stool containing the parasite is viewed under an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope the parasite appears blue or green against a black background. Molecular diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, are used to look for the parasite's DNA in the stool.\n    \nMore on: Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of cyclosporiasis"

            "answer": "The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.\n                \nThere may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.\n                \nThe acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.\n                \nDisease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.\n                \nOnce a person begins to exhibit signs of the disease, survival is rare. To date less than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported and only two have not had a history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis."

            "answer": "Any animal bitten or scratched by either a wild, carnivorous mammal or a bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies.\n  \nUnvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months and vaccinated 1 month before being released.\n  \nAnimals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated are kept under observation for 45 days.\n  \nSmall mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rabbits, and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States. Bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area.\n  \nHowever, from 1985 through 1994, woodchucks accounted for 86% of the 368 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC. Woodchucks or groundhogs (Marmota monax) are the only rodents that may be frequently submitted to state health department because of a suspicion of rabies. In all cases involving rodents, the state or local health department should be consulted before a decision is made to initiate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n  Is there rabies in my area?\n  \nEach state collects specific information about rabies, and is the best source for information on rabies in your area. In addition, the CDC publishes rabies surveillance data every year for the United States. The report, entitled Rabies Surveillance in the United States, contains information about the number of cases of rabies reported to CDC during the year, the animals reported rabid, maps showing where cases were reported for wild and domestic animals, and distribution maps showing outbreaks of rabies associated with specific animals."

            "answer": "In animals, rabies is diagnosed using the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, which looks for the presence of rabies virus antigens in brain tissue. In humans, several tests are required.\n \nRapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of postexposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel. The laboratory results may save a patient from unnecessary physical and psychological trauma, and financial burdens, if the animal is not rabid.\n \nIn addition, laboratory identification of positive rabies cases may aid in defining current epidemiologic patterns of disease and provide appropriate information for the development of rabies control programs.\n \nThe nature of rabies disease dictates that laboratory tests be standardized, rapid, sensitive, specific, economical, and reliable."

            "answer": "LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations. \n                \nFor infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. \n                \nFollowing a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. \n                \nPrevious observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. \n                \nWomen who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness. \n                \nLCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%."

Breeders, pet stores, and pet owners should take measures to prevent infestations of wild rodents. Pet rodents should not come into contact with wild rodents. If you have a pet rodent, wash your hands with soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled) after handling rodents or their cages and bedding. \n                \nIf you have a rodent infestation in and around your home, take the following precautions to reduce the risk of LCMV infection: \n \n - Seal up rodent entry holes or gaps with steel wool, lath metal, or caulk. \n - Trap rats and mice by using an appropriate snap trap. \n - Clean up rodent food sources and nesting sites and take precautions when cleaning rodent-infected areas: \n   \n   - Use cross-ventilation when entering a previously unventilated enclosed room or dwelling prior to cleanup. \n   - Put on rubber, latex, vinyl or nitrile gloves. \n   - Do not stir up dust by vacuuming, sweeping, or any other means. \n   - Thoroughly wet contaminated areas with a bleach solution or household disinfectant. \n   - Hypochlorite (bleach) solution: Mix 1 and 1/2 cups of household bleach in 1 gallon of water. \n   - Once everything is wet, take up contaminated materials with damp towel and then mop or sponge the area with bleach solution or household disinfectant. \n   - Spray dead rodents with disinfectant and then double-bag along with all cleaning materials and throw bag out in an appropriate waste disposal system. \n   - Remove the gloves and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled). \n    \n \n                \nThe geographic distributions of the rodent hosts are widespread both domestically and abroad. However, infrequent recognition and diagnosis, and historic underreporting of LCM, have limited scientists' ability to estimate incidence rates and prevalence of disease among humans. Understanding the epidemiology of LCM and LCMV infections will help to further delineate risk factors for infection and develop effective preventive strategies. Increasing physician awareness will improve disease recognition and reporting, which may lead to better characterization of the natural history and the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of disease, and stimulate future therapeutic research and development."

        {
            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness)? ?",
            "answer": "There are two subspecies of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei that cause disease in humans. The clinical features of the infection depend on the subspecies involved. The two subspecies are found in different regions of Africa. At present, there is no overlap in their geographic distribution.\n    \nT. b. rhodesiense (East African sleeping sickness) is found in focal areas of eastern and southeastern Africa. Each year a few hundred cases are reported to the World Health Organization. Over 95% of the cases of human infection occur in Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Zambia. Animals are the primary reservoir of infection. Cattle have been implicated in the spread of the disease to new areas and in local outbreaks. A wild animal reservoir is thought to be responsible for sporadic transmission to hunters and visitors to game parks. Infection of international travelers is rare, but it occasionally occurs. In the U.S., one case per year, on average, is diagnosed. Most cases of sleeping sickness imported into the U.S. have been in travelers who were on safari in East Africa.\n    \nT. b. gambiense (West African sleeping sickness) is found predominantly in central Africa and in limited areas of West Africa. Most of the sleeping sickness in Africa is caused by this form of the parasite. Epidemics of sleeping sickness have been a significant public health problem in the past, but the disease is reasonably well-controlled at present, with 7,000-10,000 cases reported annually in recent years. Over 95% of the cases of human infection are found in Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sudan, Central African Republic, Chad, and northern Uganda. Humans are the important reservoir of infection, although the parasite can sometimes be found in domestic animals (e.g., pigs, dogs, goats). Imported infection in the U.S. is extremely rare, and most cases have occurred in African nationals who have immigrated rather than in returning U.S. travelers.\n    \n     \n    \n    \nBoth forms of sleeping sickness are transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly (Glossina species). Tsetse flies inhabit rural areas, living in the woodlands and thickets that dot the East African savannah. In central and West Africa, they live in the forests and vegetation along streams. Tsetse flies bite during daylight hours. Both male and female flies can transmit the infection, but even in areas where the disease is endemic, only a very small percentage of flies are infected. Although the vast majority of infections are transmitted by the tsetse fly, other modes of transmission are possible. Occasionally, a pregnant woman can pass the infection to her unborn baby. In theory, the infection can also be transmitted by blood transfusion or sexual contact, but such cases have rarely been documented.\n   \n  \n  \n  \nThis information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider. If you have any questions about the parasites described above or think that you may have a parasitic infection, consult a health care provider."

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness) ?",
            "answer": "The diagnosis of African Trypanosomiasis is made through laboratory methods, because the clinical features of infection are not sufficiently specific. The diagnosis rests on finding the parasite in body fluid or tissue by microscopy. The parasite load in T. b. rhodesiense infection is substantially higher than the level in T. b. gambiense infection.\n    \nT. b. rhodesiense parasites can easily be found in blood. They can also be found in lymph node fluid or in fluid or biopsy of a chancre. Serologic testing is not widely available and is not used in the diagnosis, since microscopic detection of the parasite is straightforward.\n    \nThe classic method for diagnosing T. b. gambiense infection is by microscopic examination of lymph node aspirate, usually from a posterior cervical node. It is often difficult to detect T. b. gambiense in blood. Concentration techniques and serial examinations are frequently needed. Serologic testing is available outside the U.S. for T. b. gambiense; however, it normally is used for screening purposes only and the definitive diagnosis rests on microscopic observation of the parasite.\n    \nAll patients diagnosed with African trypanosomiasis must have their cerebrospinal fluid examined to determine whether there is involvement of the central nervous system, since the choice of treatment drug(s) will depend on the disease stage. The World Health Organization criteria for central nervous system involvement include increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid and a white cell count of more than 5. Trypanosomes can often be observed in cerebrospinal fluid in persons with second stage infection.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis"

            "answer": "All persons diagnosed with African Trypanosomiasis should receive treatment. The specific drug and treatment course will depend on the type of infection (T. b. gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense) and the disease stage (i.e. whether the central nervous system has been invaded by the parasite). Pentamidine, which is the recommended drug for first stage T. b. gambiense infection, is widely available in the U.S. The other drugs (suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox) used to treat African trypanosomiasis are available in the U.S. only from the CDC. Physicians can consult with CDC staff for advice on diagnosis and management and to obtain otherwise unavailable treatment drug.\n    \nThere is no test of cure for African trypanosomiasis.

            "question": "How to prevent Parasites - African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness) ?",
            "answer": "There is no vaccine or drug for prophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis. Preventive measures are aimed at minimizing contact with tsetse flies. Local residents are usually aware of the areas that are heavily infested and they can provide advice about places to avoid. Other helpful measures include:\n    \n     - Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants of medium-weight material in neutral colors that blend with the background environment. Tsetse flies are attracted to bright or dark colors, and they can bite through lightweight clothing.\n     - Inspect vehicles before entering. The flies are attracted to the motion and dust from moving vehicles.\n     - Avoid bushes. The tsetse fly is less active during the hottest part of the day but will bite if disturbed.\n     - Use insect repellent. Permethrin-impregnated clothing and insect repellent have not been proved to be particularly effective against tsetse flies, but they will prevent other insect bites that can cause illness.\n    \n    \nControl of African trypanosomiasis rests on two strategies: reducing the disease reservoir and controlling the tsetse fly vector. Because humans are the significant disease reservoir for T. b. gambiense, the main control strategy for this subspecies is active case-finding through population screening, followed by treatment of the infected persons that are identified. Tsetse fly traps are sometimes used as an adjunct. Reducing the reservoir of infection is more difficult for T. b. rhodesiense, since there are a variety of animal hosts. Vector control is the primary strategy in use. This is usually done with traps or screens, in combination with insecticides and odors that attract the flies."

However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8\u00b5g/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is \u226516\u00b5g/ml.

Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8\u00b5g/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is \u226516\u00b5g/ml.

            "answer": "Marine toxins are naturally occurring chemicals that can contaminate certain seafood. The seafood contaminated with these chemicals frequently looks, smells, and tastes normal. When humans eat such seafood, disease can result."
        },
        {
            "question": "how can these diseases be diagnosed for Marine Toxins ?",
            "answer": "Diagnosis of marine toxin poisoning is generally based on symptoms and a history of recently eating a particular kind of seafood. Laboratory testing for the specific toxin in patient samples is generally not necessary because this requires special techniques and equipment available in only specialized laboratories. If suspect, leftover fish or shellfish are available, they can be tested for the presence of the toxin more easily. Identification of the specific toxin is not usually necessary for treating patients because there is no specific treatment."

            "answer": "Other than supportive care there are few specific treatments for ciguatera poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, or amnesic shellfish poisoning. Antihistamines and epinephrine, however, may sometimes be useful in treating the symptoms of scombrotoxic fish poisoning. Intravenous mannitol has been suggested for the treatment of severe ciguatera poisoning."

            "answer": "Every year, approximately 30 cases of poisoning by marine toxins are reported in the United States. Because healthcare providers are not required to report these illnesses and because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of poisonings may be much greater. Toxic seafood poisonings are more common in the summer than winter because dinoflagelates grow well in warmer seasons. It is estimated from cases with available data that one person dies every 4 years from toxic seafood poisonings."

Based on the results of such testing, recreational and commercial seafood harvesting may be prohibited locally during periods of risk. State and federal regulatory agencies monitor reported cases of marine toxin poisoning, and health departments investigate possible outbreaks and devise control measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides support to investigators as needed."

            "question": "what else can be done to prevent these diseases for Marine Toxins ?",
            "answer": "It is important to notify public health departments about even one person with marine toxin poisoning. Public health departments can then investigate to determine if a restaurant, oyster bed, or fishing area has a problem. This prevents other illnesses. In any food poisoning occurrence, consumers should note foods eaten and freeze any uneaten portions in case they need to be tested. A commercial test has been developed in Hawaii to allow persons to test sport caught fish for ciguatoxins."

            "answer": "Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to animals and people by insect vectors that are found only in the Americas (mainly, in rural areas of Latin America where poverty is widespread). Chagas disease (T. cruzi infection) is also referred to as American trypanosomiasis.\nIt is estimated that as many as 8 million people in Mexico, Central America, and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. If untreated, infection is lifelong and can be life threatening.\nThe impact of Chagas disease is not limited to the rural areas in Latin America in which vectorborne transmission occurs. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution and changed the epidemiology of Chagas disease. In the United States and in other regions where Chagas disease is now found but is not endemic, control strategies should focus on preventing transmission from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and mother-to-baby (congenital transmission)."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - American Trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas Disease)? ?",
            "answer": "Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Infection is most commonly acquired through contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug (or \"kissing bug\"), a blood-sucking insect that feeds on humans and animals.\n    \nInfection can also occur from:\n    \n     - mother-to-baby (congenital),\n     - contaminated blood products (transfusions),\n     - an organ transplanted from an infected donor,\n     - laboratory accident, or\n     - contaminated food or drink (rare)\n    \n    \nChagas disease is endemic throughout much of Mexico, Central America, and South America where an estimated 8 million people are infected. The triatomine bug thrives under poor housing conditions (for example, mud walls, thatched roofs), so in endemic countries, people living in rural areas are at greatest risk for acquiring infection. Public health efforts aimed at preventing transmission have decreased the number of newly infected people and completely halted vectorborne transmission in some areas. Infection acquired from blood products, organ transplantation, or congenital transmission continues to pose a threat.\n    \nBy applying published seroprevalence figures to immigrant populations, CDC estimates that more than 300,000 persons with Trypanosoma cruzi infection live in the United States. Most people with Chagas disease in the United States acquired their infections in endemic countries. Although there are triatomine bugs in the U.S. , only rare vectorborne cases of Chagas disease have been documented.\n    \nMore on: Triatomine Bugs"

            "question": "How to diagnose Parasites - American Trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas Disease) ?",
            "answer": "The diagnosis of Chagas disease can be made by observation of the parasite in a blood smear by microscopic examination. A thick and thin blood smear are made and stained for visualization of parasites. However, a blood smear works well only in the acute phase of infection when parasites are seen circulating in blood.\n    \nDiagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is made after consideration of the patient's clinical findings, as well as by the likelihood of being infected, such as having lived in an endemic country. Diagnosis is generally made by testing with at least two different serologic tests."

Adults with chronic infection may also benefit from treatment.\n    \nFor cardiac or gastrointestinal problems resulting from Chagas disease, symptomatic treatment may be helpful. Patients should consult with their primary health care provider. Some patients may be referred to a specialist, such as a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, or infectious disease specialist.\n    \nIn the U.S., medication for Chagas is available only through CDC.

            "answer": "In endemic areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America improved housing and spraying insecticide inside housing to eliminate triatomine bugs has significantly decreased the spread of Chagas disease. Further, screening of blood donations for Chagas is another important public health tool in helping to prevent transfusion-acquired disease. Early detection and treatment of new cases, including mother-to-baby (congenital) cases, will also help reduce the burden of disease.\n    \nIn the United States and in other regions where Chagas disease is now found but is not endemic, control strategies are focused on preventing transmission from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and mother-to-baby."

            "answer": "Chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS, is a devastating and complex disorder. People with CFS have overwhelming fatigue and a host of other symptoms that are not improved by bed rest and that can get worse after physical activity or mental exertion. They often function at a substantially lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill.\n  \nBesides severe fatigue, other symptoms include muscle pain, impaired memory or mental concentration, insomnia, and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours. In some cases, CFS can persist for years.\n  \nResearchers have not yet identified what causes CFS, and there are no tests to diagnose CFS. Moreover, because many illnesses have fatigue as a symptom, doctors need to take care to rule out other conditions, which may be treatable."
        },
        {
            "question": "What causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?",
            "answer": "Despite a vigorous search, scientists have not yet identified what causes CFS. While a single cause for CFS may yet be identified, another possibility is that CFS has multiple causes. Conditions that have been studied to determine if they cause or trigger the development of CFS include infections, immune disorders, stress, trauma, and toxins.\n  Infection\n  \nVarious types of infections have been studied to determine if they might cause or trigger CFS:\n  \n   - Candida albicans, a fungus that causes yeast infections\n   - Mycoplasma, a cause of atypical pneumonia\n   - Ross River virus, which causes Ross River Fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease\n  \n  Could One Type of Infection Lead to CFS?\n  \nResearchers from around the world have studied if a single type of infection might be the cause of CFS, analyzed the data, and not yet found any association between CFS and infection. Researchers are still analyzing samples from CFS patients using the latest molecular methods to search for previously unknown infections (pathogen discovery). To date, these studies suggest that no one infection or pathogen causes CFS and that the illness may be triggered by a variety of illnesses or conditions. In fact, infection with Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus, and Coxiella burnetti will lead to a post-infective condition that meets the criteria for CFS in approximately 10-12% of cases. People who had severe symptoms when they became infected were more likely than those with mild symptoms to later develop CFS symptoms. The possibility remains that there may be a variety of different ways in which patients can develop CFS.\n  Immune System and Allergies\n  \nStudies have looked to see if changes in a person's immune system might lead to CFS. The findings have been mixed. Similarities in symptoms from immune responses to infection and CFS lead to hypotheses that CFS may be caused by stress or a viral infection, which may lead to the chronic production of cytokines and then to CFS.\n  \nAntibodies against normal parts of the body (auto-antibodies) and immune complexes have been seen in some CFS patients. However, no associated tissue damage typical of autoimmune disease has been described in CFS patients. The opportunistic infections or increased risk for cancer observed in persons with immunodeficiency diseases or in immunosuppressed individuals is also not observed in CFS.\n  \nT-cell activation markers have been reported to be different between groups of CFS patients and healthy persons, but not all investigators have consistently observed these differences.\n  \nAllergic diseases and secondary illnesses such as sinusitis could be one predisposing factor for CFS, but not all CFS patients have allergies. Many patients do, however, report intolerances for certain substances that may be found in foods or over-the-counter medications, such as alcohol.\n  \n                \n  Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis\n  \nThe central nervous system plays an important role in CFS. Physical or emotional stress, which is commonly reported as a pre-onset condition in CFS patients, alters the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or HPA axis, leading to altered release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), cortisol, and other hormones. These hormones can influence the immune system and many other body systems.\n  \nSome CFS patients produce lower levels of cortisol than do healthy people. Similar hormonal abnormalities have also been observed among CFS patients and in persons with related disorders like fibromyalgia. Cortisol suppresses inflammation and cellular immune activation, and reduced levels might relax constraints on inflammatory processes and immune cell activation. Even though CFS patients had lower levels of cortisol than healthy individuals, their cortisol levels were still within the acceptable range of what is considered normal. Therefore, doctors cannot use cortisol levels as a way to diagnose CFS.\n  \n                \n  Abnormally Low Blood Pressure and Lightheadedness (Neurally Mediated Hypotension)\n  \nDisturbances in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and pulse have been found in CFS patients. This problem with maintaining blood pressure can be diagnosed by using tilt table testing, which involves laying the patient horizontally on a table and then tilting the table upright to 70 degrees for 45 minutes while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. Persons with neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) or postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) will develop lower blood pressure under these conditions, as well as other characteristic symptoms, such as lightheadedness, visual dimming, or a slow response to verbal stimuli. Others may develop an unusually rapid heart rate also associated with the symptoms of the syndrome. Many CFS patients experience lightheadedness or worsened fatigue when they stand for prolonged periods or when in warm places, such as in a hot shower -- all circumstances that are known to trigger NMH or POTS.\n  \nNMH and/or POTS share some of the symptoms of CFS. They should be considered in a CFS patients whose symptoms are worsened with changes in position, after eating, following unusual amounts of or inadequate fluid intake, or increases in activity. Not all patients with CFS will have these conditions, however.\n  \n                \n  Nutritional Deficiency\n  \nThere is no published scientific evidence that CFS is caused by a nutritional deficiency. While evidence is currently lacking for nutritional defects in CFS patients, it should also be added that a balanced diet can be favorable to better health in general and would be expected to benefit a person with any chronic illness."

            "question": "How to diagnose Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?",
            "answer": "Diagnostic Challenges\n  \nFor doctors, diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be complicated by a number of factors:\n  \n   - There's no lab test or biomarker for CFS.\n   - Fatigue and other symptoms of CFS are common to many illnesses.\n   - For some CFS patients, it may not be obvious to doctors that they are ill.\n   - The illness has a pattern of remission and relapse.\n   - Symptoms vary from person to person in type, number, and severity.\n  \n  \nThese factors have contributed to a low diagnosis rate. Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.\n  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS\n  \nBecause there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.\n  \nIf a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:\n  \n   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms\n   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed\n   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated\n   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests\n  \n  \nA CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.\n  \nThe complete process for diagnosing CFS can be found here.\n  \nAdditional information for healthcare professionals on use of tests can be found here."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?",
            "answer": "Chronic fatigue syndrome can be misdiagnosed or overlooked because its symptoms are similar to so many other illnesses. Fatigue, for instance, can be a symptom for hundreds of illnesses. Looking closer at the nature of the symptoms though, can help a doctor distinguish CFS from other illnesses.\n  Primary Symptoms\n  \nAs the name chronic fatigue syndrome suggests, fatigue is one part of this illness. With CFS, however, the fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms. In addition, the fatigue is not the kind you might feel after a particularly busy day or week, after a sleepless night, or after a single stressful event. It's a severe, incapacitating fatigue that isn't improved by bed rest and that is often worsened by physical activity or mental exertion. It's an all-encompassing fatigue that can dramatically reduce a person's activity level and stamina.\n  \nPeople with CFS function at a significantly lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill. The illness results in a substantial reduction in work-related, personal, social, and educational activities.\n  \nThe fatigue of CFS is accompanied by characteristic illness symptoms lasting at least 6 months. These symptoms include:\n  \n   - increased malaise (extreme exhaustion and sickness) following physical activity or mental exertion\n   - problems with sleep\n   - difficulties with memory and concentration\n   - persistent muscle pain\n   - joint pain (without redness or swelling)\n   - headache\n   - tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit\n   - sore throat\n  \n  Other Symptoms\n  \nThe symptoms listed above are the symptoms used to diagnose CFS. However, many CFS patients and patients in general may experience other symptoms, including:\n  \n   - brain fog (feeling like you're in a mental fog)\n   - difficulty maintaining an upright position, dizziness, balance problems or fainting\n   - allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, medications, or noise\n   - irritable bowel\n   - chills and night sweats\n   - visual disturbances (sensitivity to light, blurring, eye pain)\n   - depression or mood problems (irritability, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks)\n  \n  \nIt's important to tell your health care professional if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. You might have CFS, or you might have another treatable disorder. Only a health care professional can diagnose CFS.\n  What's the Clinical Course of CFS?\n  \nThe severity of CFS varies from patient to patient. Some people can maintain fairly active lives. For most patients, however, CFS significantly limits their work, school, and family activities for periods of time.\n  \nWhile symptoms vary from person to person in number, type, and severity, all CFS patients are limited in what they can do to some degree. CDC studies show that CFS can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and similar chronic conditions.\n  \nCFS often affects patients in cycles: Patients will have periods of illness followed by periods of relative well-being. For some patients, symptoms may diminish or even go into complete remission; however, they often recur at a later point in time. This pattern of remission and relapse makes CFS especially hard for patients to manage. Patients who are in remission may be tempted to overdo activities when they're feeling better, but this overexertion may actually contribute to a relapse.\n  \nThe percentage of CFS patients who recover is unknown, but there is some evidence to indicate that patients benefit when accompanying conditions are identified and treated and when symptoms are managed. High-quality health care is important."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?",
            "answer": "Introduction\n  \nManaging chronic fatigue syndrome can be as complex as the illness itself. There is no cure, no prescription drugs have been developed specifically for CFS, and symptoms can vary a lot over time. Thus, people with CFS should closely monitor their health and let their doctor know of any changes; and doctors should regularly monitor their patients' conditions and change treatment strategies as needed.\n  \nA team approach that involves doctors and patients is one key to successfully managing CFS. Patients and their doctors can work together to create an individualized treatment program that best meets the needs of the patient with CFS. This program should be based on a combination of therapies that address symptoms, coping techniques, and managing normal daily activities.\n  \nCFS affects patients in different ways, and the treatment plan should be tailored to address symptoms that are most disruptive or disabling for each patient. Helping the patient get relief from symptoms is the main goal of treatment. However, expecting a patient to return to usual activities should not be the immediate goal because the physical and mental exertion needed to try to reach that goal may aggravate the illness.\n  \nBecause CFS is a complicated illness, its management may require input from a variety of medical professionals. Primary care providers can develop effective treatment plans based on their experience in treating other illnesses. Patients benefit when they can work in collaboration with a team of doctors and other health care professionals, who might also include rehabilitation specialists, mental health professionals, and physical or exercise therapists.\n  Difficulties of Living with CFS\n  \nLiving with chronic fatigue syndrome can be difficult. Like other debilitating chronic illnesses, CFS can have a devastating impact on patients' daily lives and require them to make major lifestyle changes to adapt to many new limitations.\n  \nCommon difficulties for CFS patients include problems coping with:\n  \n   - the changing and unpredictable symptoms\n   - a decrease in stamina that interferes with activities of daily life\n   - memory and concentration problems that seriously hurt work or school performance\n   - loss of independence, livelihood, and economic security\n   - alterations in relationships with partners, family members, and friends\n   - worries about raising children\n  \n  \nFeelings of anger, guilt, anxiety, isolation and abandonment are common in CFS patients. While it's OK to have such feelings, unresolved emotions and stress can make symptoms worse, interfere with prescription drug therapies, and make recovery harder."

            "question": "What is (are) Parasites - Trichinellosis (also known as Trichinosis) ?",
            "answer": "Trichinellosis, also called trichinosis, is caused by eating raw or undercooked meat of animals infected with the larvae of a species of worm called Trichinella. Infection occurs commonly in certain wild carnivorous (meat-eating) animals such as bear or cougar, or omnivorous (meat and plant-eating) animals such as domestic pigs or wild boar."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Trichinellosis (also known as Trichinosis)? ?",
            "answer": "People acquire trichinellosis by consuming raw or undercooked meat infected with the Trichinella parasite, particularly wild game meat or pork. Even tasting very small amounts of undercooked meat during preparation or cooking puts you at risk for infection. Outbreaks occur in settings where multiple people consume the same Trichinella-infected meat.\nWorldwide, an estimated 10,000 cases of trichinellosis occur every year. Several different species of Trichinella can cause human disease; the most common species is Trichinella spiralis, which has a global distribution and is the species most commonly found in pigs. Other Trichinella species are less commonly reported as the cause of human disease and may be found in different parts of the world, usually infecting wild animals.\nIn the United States, trichinellosis cases are reported to CDC much less commonly now than in the past (Figure 1). During the late 1940s, when the U.S. Public Health Service began counting cases of trichinellosis, 400 cases in the United States were recorded each year on average. During 2008-2010, 20 cases were reported to CDC each year on average. The overall number of cases reported has decreased because of improved pig-raising practices in the pork industry, commercial and home freezing of pork, and public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked meat products. The number of cases associated with raw or undercooked wild game meats has remained relatively constant over time (Figure 2). Over the past 40 years, few cases of trichinellosis have been reported in the United States, and the risk of trichinellosis from commercially raised and properly prepared pork is very low. However, eating undercooked wild game, particularly bear meat, puts one at risk for acquiring this disease."

Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. The most common forms are cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow)."

            "question": "Who is at risk for Parasites - Leishmaniasis? ?",
            "answer": "Leishmaniasis is found in people in focal areas of more than 90 countries in the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. The ecologic settings range from rain forests to deserts. Leishmaniasis usually is more common in rural than in urban areas, but it is found in the outskirts of some cities. Climate and other environmental changes have the potential to expand the geographic range of the sand fly vectors and the areas in the world where leishmaniasis is found.\n    \nLeishmaniasis is found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica.\n    \n     - In the Old World (the Eastern Hemisphere), leishmaniasis is found in some parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa (particularly in the tropical region and North Africa, with some cases elsewhere), and southern Europe. It is not found in Australia or the Pacific islands.\n     - In the New World (the Western Hemisphere), it is found in some parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is not found in Chile or Uruguay. Occasional cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been acquired in Texas and Oklahoma.\n    \n    \nThe number of new cases per year is not known with certainty. For cutaneous leishmaniasis, estimates of the number of cases range from approximately 0.7 million (700,000) to 1.2 million (1,200,000). For visceral leishmaniasis, estimates of the number of cases range from approximately 0.2 million (200,000) to 0.4 million (400,000). The cases of leishmaniasis evaluated in the United States reflect travel and immigration patterns. For example, many of the cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in U.S. civilian travelers have been acquired in common tourist destinations in Latin America, such as in Costa Rica.\n    \nOverall, infection in people is caused by more than 20 species (types) of Leishmania parasites, which are spread by about 30 species of phlebotomine sand flies; particular species of the parasite are spread by particular sand flies. The sand fly vectors generally are the most active during twilight, evening, and night-time hours (from dusk to dawn).\n    \nIn many geographic areas where leishmaniasis is found in people, infected people are not needed to maintain the transmission cycle of the parasite in nature; infected animals (such as rodents or dogs), along with sand flies, maintain the cycle. However, in some parts of the world, infected people are needed to maintain the cycle; this type of transmission (human\u2014sand fly\u2014human) is called anthroponotic. In areas with anthroponotic transmission, effective treatment of individual patients can help control the spread of the parasite."

Most people have between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time, usually until about age 40. In older people, they tend to fade away.    Moles are usually pink, tan or brown. They can be flat or raised. They are usually round or oval and no larger than a pencil eraser.    About one out of every ten people has at least one unusual (or atypical) mole that looks different from an ordinary mole. They are called dysplastic nevi. They may be more likely than ordinary moles to develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer. You should have a health care professional check your moles if they look unusual, grow larger, change in color or outline, or in any other way.    NIH: National Cancer Institute"

            "answer": "Osteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones, new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis, the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.    You can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees, shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age, but it usually strikes in your thirties, forties or fifties.     At first, you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse, you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well.     No one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include        -  Long-term steroid treatment    -  Alcohol abuse    -  Joint injuries    -  Having certain diseases, including arthritis and cancer        Doctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis.

            "question": "What is (are) Coronary Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.    CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.     Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities.     AD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. People with AD may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.    In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.    AD usually begins after age 60. The risk goes up as you get older. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease.     No treatment can stop the disease.

            "answer": "Gout is a common, painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen, red, hot and stiff joints.    Gout happens when uric acid builds up in your body. Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods, such as liver, dried beans and peas, and anchovies. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints, it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.    Often, gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles, heels, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows. At first, gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually, attacks last longer and happen more often.    You are more likely to get gout if you       - Are a man    - Have family member with gout    - Are overweight    - Drink alcohol    - Eat too many foods rich in purines       Gout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.    Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.

They check for liver damage, and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases, treatments, and possible side effects of medicines.    Liver function tests measure certain proteins, enzymes, and substances, including:       - Albumin, a protein that the liver makes    - Total protein (TP)    - Enzymes that are found in the liver, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)    - Bilirubin, a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.    - Prothrombin time, which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver."

Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.    In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily insulin injections.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

            "answer": "Voice is the sound made by air passing from your lungs through your larynx, or voice box. In your larynx are your vocal cords, two bands of muscle that vibrate to make sound. For most of us, our voices play a big part in who we are, what we do, and how we communicate. Like fingerprints, each person's voice is unique.    Many things we do can injure our vocal cords. Talking too much, screaming, constantly clearing your throat, or smoking can make you hoarse. They can also lead to problems such as nodules, polyps, and sores on the vocal cords. Other causes of voice disorders include infections, upward movement of stomach acids into the throat, growths due to a virus, cancer, and diseases that paralyze the vocal cords.    Signs that your voice isn't healthy include       - Your voice has become hoarse or raspy    - You've lost the ability to hit some high notes when singing    - Your voice suddenly sounds deeper    - Your throat often feels raw, achy, or strained    - It's become an effort to talk       Treatment for voice disorders varies depending on the cause.

If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from age, physical problems, hormone problems, and lifestyle or environmental factors.    Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg.    About a third of the time, infertility is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time, it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found.    If you think you might be infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause, treatments may include medicines, surgery, or assisted reproductive technologies. Happily, many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.

            "answer": "Summary : Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are procedures that let your doctor look inside your large intestine. They use instruments called scopes. Scopes have a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube. The procedures let your doctor see things such as inflamed tissue, abnormal growths, and ulcers.     Colonoscopy checks your entire colon and rectum. Sigmoidoscopy checks the rectum and the lower colon only.    Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures       - To look for early signs of cancer in the colon and rectum. It may be part of a routine screening, which usually starts at age 50.    - To look for causes of unexplained changes in bowel habits    - To evaluate symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss       Your doctor can also remove polyps from your colon during these procedures.    You will get written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the procedure. The bowel prep cleans out the intestine so your doctor can see everything clearly. During a colonoscopy, you get medicines to keep you relaxed. You usually do not need them for a sigmoidoscopy.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

            "answer": "Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.    A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.    Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and, sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

            "answer": "Birthmarks are abnormalities of the skin that are present when a baby is born. There are two types of birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are made up of blood vessels that haven't formed correctly. They are usually red. Two types of vascular birthmarks are hemangiomas and port-wine stains. Pigmented birthmarks are made of a cluster of pigment cells which cause color in skin. They can be many different colors, from tan to brown, gray to black, or even blue. Moles can be birthmarks.    No one knows what causes many types of birthmarks, but some run in families. Your baby's doctor will look at the birthmark to see if it needs any treatment or if it should be watched. Pigmented birthmarks aren't usually treated, except for moles. Treatment for vascular birthmarks includes laser surgery.     Most birthmarks are not serious, and some go away on their own. Some stay the same or get worse as you get older. Usually birthmarks are only a concern for your appearance. But certain types can increase your risk of skin cancer. If your birthmark bleeds, hurts, itches, or becomes infected, call your health care provider."

            "question": "What is (are) Carotid Artery Disease ?",
            "answer": "Your carotid arteries are two large blood vessels in your neck. They supply your brain with blood. If you have carotid artery disease, the arteries become narrow, usually because of atherosclerosis. This is the buildup of cholesterol and other material in an artery. If a blood clot sticks in the narrowed arteries, blood can't reach your brain. This is one of the causes of stroke.     Carotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms, but there are tests that can tell your doctor if you have it. If the arteries are very narrow, you may need an operation called an endarterectomy to remove the plaque. For less severe narrowing, a medicine to prevent blood clots can reduce your risk of stroke. Another option for people who can't have surgery is carotid angioplasty. This involves placing balloons and/or stents into the artery to open it and hold it open."

Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Children grow at different rates, so it isn't always easy to know when a child is obese or overweight. Ask your health care provider to check whether your child's weight and height are in a healthy range.    If a weight-loss program is necessary, involve the whole family in healthy habits so your child doesn't feel singled out. Encourage healthy eating by       - Serving more fruits and vegetables    - Buying fewer soft drinks and high-fat, high-calorie snack foods    - Making sure your child eats breakfast every day    - Eating fast food less often    - Not using food as a reward       Physical activity is also very important. Kids need about 60 minutes each day. It does not have to happen all at once. Several short periods of activity during the day are just as good.

It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.    Symptoms of stroke are       - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)    - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech    - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination    - Sudden severe headache with no known cause       It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.

            "answer": "Summary : When it comes to taking medicines, kids aren't just small adults. For prescription medicines, there is a \"Pediatric\" section of the label. It says whether the medication has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you what ages have been studied. Aside from drugs for fever or pain, most over-the-counter products haven't actually been studied in children for effectiveness, safety, or dosing.    When you give medicine to your child, be sure you're giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions. Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only, don't guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction. Follow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don't give to children under a certain age or weight, don't do it.    Food and Drug Administration"

            "answer": "Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. If your thyroid is too active, it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is called hyperthyroidism.    Hyperthyroidism is more common in women, people with other thyroid problems, and those over 60 years old. Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder, is the most common cause. Other causes include thyroid nodules, thyroiditis, consuming too much iodine, and taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.    The symptoms can vary from person to person. They may include       - Being nervous or irritable    - Mood swings    - Fatigue or muscle weakness    - Heat intolerance    - Trouble sleeping    - Hand tremors    - Rapid and irregular heartbeat    - Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea    - Weight loss    - Goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollen       To diagnose hyperthyroidism, your doctor will look at your symptoms, blood tests, and sometimes a thyroid scan. Treatment is with medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. No single treatment works for everyone.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

It damages the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body, leading to the symptoms of MS. They can include       - Visual disturbances    - Muscle weakness    - Trouble with coordination and balance    - Sensations such as numbness, prickling, or \"pins and needles\"     - Thinking and memory problems       No one knows what causes MS. It may be an autoimmune disease, which happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Multiple sclerosis affects women more than men. It often begins between the ages of 20 and 40. Usually, the disease is mild, but some people lose the ability to write, speak, or walk.    There is no single test for MS. Doctors use a medical history, physical exam, neurological exam, MRI, and other tests to diagnose it. There is no cure for MS, but medicines may slow it down and help control symptoms.

When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. When these extra cells form a mass, it is called a tumor.    Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so, they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs, such as your brain.    Treatment often involves surgery.

            "answer": "Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.    Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Gallstone attacks usually happen after you eat. Signs of a gallstone attack may include nausea, vomiting, or pain in the abdomen, back, or just under the right arm.    Gallstones are most common among older adults, women, overweight people, Native Americans and Mexican Americans.    Gallstones are often found during imaging tests for other health conditions. If you do not have symptoms, you usually do not need treatment. The most common treatment is removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder.

            "answer": "Summary : Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.     ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner.     The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body."

It compares your bone density, or mass, to that of a healthy person who is the same age and sex as you are. It can show       - Whether you have osteoporosis, a disease that makes your bones weak    - Your risk for breaking bones    - Whether your osteoporosis treatment is working       Low bone mass that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia. Causes of low bone mass include family history, not developing good bone mass when you are young, and certain conditions or medicines. Not everyone who has low bone mass gets osteoporosis, but they are at higher risk for getting it.    If you have low bone mass, there are things you can do to help slow down bone loss. These include eating foods rich in calcium and vitamin D and doing weight-bearing exercise such as walking, tennis, or dancing.

            "answer": "Most brain malformations begin long before a baby is born. Something damages the developing nervous system or causes it to develop abnormally. Sometimes it's a genetic problem. In other cases, exposure to certain medicines, infections, or radiation during pregnancy interferes with brain development. Parts of the brain may be missing, abnormally small or large, or not fully developed.    Treatment depends upon the problem. In many cases, treatment only helps with symptoms. It may include antiseizure medicines, shunts to drain fluid from the brain, and physical therapy.    There are head malformations that do not involve the brain. Craniofacial disorders are the result of abnormal growth of soft tissue and bones in the face and head. It's common for new babies to have slightly uneven heads, but parents should watch the shape of their baby's head for possible problems.

            "answer": "Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Both men and women can get it.    Chlamydia usually doesn't cause symptoms. If it does, you might notice a burning feeling when you urinate or abnormal discharge from your vagina or penis.    In both men and women, chlamydia can infect the urinary tract. In women, infection of the reproductive system can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility or serious problems with pregnancy. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. In men, chlamydia can infect the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm. This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.    A lab test can tell if you have chlamydia. Antibiotics will cure the infection. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. Experts recommend that sexually active women 25 and younger get a chlamydia test every year.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"

            "answer": "The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.    Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.    Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones. Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain.    Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support.

Histoplasmosis is often mild, with no symptoms. If you do get sick, it usually affects your lungs. Symptoms include feeling ill, fever, chest pains, and a dry cough. In severe cases, histoplasmosis spreads to other organs. This is called disseminated disease. It is more common in infants, young children, seniors, and people with immune system problems.    Your doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis, including a chest x-ray, CT scan of the lungs, or examining blood, urine, or tissues for signs of the fungus.

            "question": "Do you have information about X-Rays",
            "answer": "Summary : X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less, and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black.    The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for broken bones, but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.    When you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example, a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days."

            "question": "What is (are) Refractive Errors ?",
            "answer": "The cornea and lens of your eye helps you focus. Refractive errors are vision problems that happen when the shape of the eye keeps you from focusing well. The cause could be the length of the eyeball (longer or shorter), changes in the shape of the cornea, or aging of the lens.    Four common refractive errors are       - Myopia, or nearsightedness - clear vision close up but blurry in the distance    - Hyperopia, or farsightedness - clear vision in the distance but blurry close up    - Presbyopia - inability to focus close up as a result of aging    - Astigmatism - focus problems caused by the cornea       The most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include double vision, haziness, glare or halos around bright lights, squinting, headaches, or eye strain.    Glasses or contact lenses can usually correct refractive errors. Laser eye surgery may also be a possibility.    NIH: National Eye Institute"

            "question": "What is (are) Wilson Disease ?",
            "answer": "Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper. You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.    Normally, your liver releases extra copper into bile, a digestive fluid. With Wilson disease, the copper builds up in your liver, and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain, kidneys, and eyes.    Wilson disease is present at birth, but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver, the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.    Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body. You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver, as these foods may contain high levels of copper. At the beginning of treatment, you'll also need to avoid chocolate, mushrooms, and nuts. Have your drinking water checked for copper content and don't take multivitamins that contain copper.    With early detection and proper treatment, you can enjoy good health.

            "question": "What is (are) Atrial Fibrillation ?",
            "answer": "An arrhythmia is a problem with the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia. The cause is a disorder in the heart's electrical system.      Often, people who have AF may not even feel symptoms. But you may feel        - Palpitations -- an abnormal rapid heartbeat    - Shortness of breath    - Weakness or difficulty exercising    - Chest pain    - Dizziness or fainting    - Fatigue    - Confusion        AF can lead to an increased risk of stroke. In many patients, it can also cause chest pain, heart attack, or heart failure.      Doctors diagnose AF using family and medical history, a physical exam, and a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG), which looks at the electrical waves your heart makes. Treatments include medicines and procedures to restore normal rhythm.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

            "question": "Do you have information about Flu Shot",
            "answer": "Summary : Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others.    The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.    Flu vaccines can either be shots or nasal sprays. There is also a high-dose version for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.    Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have       - Had reactions to flu shots before    - Guillain-Barre Syndrome    - A fever       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
