        "abstract": "  This paper offers a precise analytical characterization of the distribution\nof returns for a portfolio constituted of assets whose returns are described by\nan arbitrary joint multivariate distribution. In this goal, we introduce a\nnon-linear transformation that maps the returns onto gaussian variables whose\ncovariance matrix provides a new measure of dependence between the non-normal\nreturns, generalizing the covariance matrix into a non-linear fractional\ncovariance matrix. This nonlinear covariance matrix is chiseled to the specific\nfat tail structure of the underlying marginal distributions, thus ensuring\nstability and good-conditionning. The portfolio distribution is obtained as the\nsolution of a mapping to a so-called phi-q field theory in particle physics, of\nwhich we offer an extensive treatment using Feynman diagrammatic techniques and\nlarge deviation theory, that we illustrate in details for multivariate Weibull\ndistributions. The main result of our theory is that minimizing the portfolio\nvariance (i.e. the relatively ``small'' risks) may often increase the large\nrisks, as measured by higher normalized cumulants. Extensive empirical tests\nare presented on the foreign exchange market that validate satisfactorily the\ntheory. For ``fat tail'' distributions, we show that an adequete prediction of\nthe risks of a portfolio relies much more on the correct description of the\ntail structure rather than on their correlations.\n"

In this work, stochastic relaxational dynamics (together with path\nintegrals) is applied to option pricing theory. A recently proposed model (by\nIlinski et al.) considers fluctuations around this equilibrium state by\nintroducing a relaxational dynamics with random noise for intermediate\ndeviations called ``virtual'' arbitrage returns. In this work, the model is\nincorporated within a martingale pricing method for derivatives on securities\n(e.g. stocks) in incomplete markets using a mapping to option pricing theory\nwith stochastic interest rates. Using a famous result by Merton and with some\nhelp from the path integral method, exact pricing formulas for European call\nand put options under the influence of virtual arbitrage returns (or\nintermediate deviations from economic equilibrium) are derived where only the\nfinal integration over initial arbitrage returns needs to be performed\nnumerically. This result is complemented by a discussion of the hedging\nstrategy associated to a derivative, which replicates the final payoff but\nturns out to be not self-financing in the real world, but self-financing {\\it\nwhen summed over the derivative's remaining life time}. Numerical examples are\ngiven which underline the fact that an additional positive risk premium (with\nrespect to the Black-Scholes values) is found reflecting extra hedging costs\ndue to intermediate deviations from economic equilibrium.\n"

The classification relies on two\ndimensionless parameters, the Froude number characterizing the relative\nstrength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon\nforecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian\npatterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon.

This ``renormalized scenario'' approach is fundamentally\nprobabilistic in nature and exemplifies the view that multiple competing\nscenarii have to be taken into account for the same past history. Empirical\ntests are performed on on about nine to thirty years of daily returns of twelve\ndata sets comprising some major indices (Dow Jones, SP500, Nasdaq, DAX, FTSE,\nNikkei), some major bonds (JGB, TYX) and some major currencies against the US\ndollar (GBP, CHF, DEM, JPY). Our ``renormalized scenario'' exhibits\nstatistically significant predictive power in essentially all market phases. In\nconstrast, a trend following strategy and trend + acceleration following\nstrategy perform well only on different and specific market phases.

Using\ninsights on the behavior of multiplicative stochastic processes, we demonstrate\nthat the tails of the unconditional distribution emerging from such bubble\nprocesses follow power-laws (exhibit hyperbolic decline). More precisely, we\nfind that rational bubbles predict a 'fat' power tail for both the bubble\ncomponent and price differences with an exponent smaller than 1, implying\nabsence of convergence of the mean. The distribution of returns is dominated by\nthe same power-law over an extended range of large returns. Although power-law\ntails are a pervasive feature of empirical data, these numerical predictions\nare in disagreement with the usual empirical estimates of an exponent between 2\nand 4.

Utility is\nusually treated by economists as a price potential, other times utility rates\nare treated as Lagrangians. Assumptions of integrability of Lagrangians and\ndynamics are implicitly and uncritically made. In particular, economists assume\nthat price is the gradient of utility in equilibrium, but I show that price as\nthe gradient of utility is an integrability condition for the Hamiltonian\ndynamics of an optimization problem in econometric control theory. One\nconsequence is that, in a nonintegrable dynamical system, price cannot be\nexpressed as a function of demand or supply variables. Another consequence is\nthat utility maximization does not describe equiulibrium. I point out that the\nmaximization of Gibbs entropy would describe equilibrium, if equilibrium could\nbe achieved, but equilibrium does not describe real markets. To emphasize the\ninconsistency of the economists' notion of 'equilibrium', I discuss both\ndeterministic and stochastic dynamics of excess demand and observe that Adam\nSmith's stabilizing hand is not to be found either in deterministic or\nstochastic dynamical models of markets, nor in the observed motions of asset\nprices.

We systematically explore this\nanalogy and quantify the relation between trading activity - measured by the\nnumber of transactions $N_{\\Delta t}$ - and the price change $G_{\\Delta t}$,\nfor a given stock, over a time interval $[t, t+\\Delta t]$. To this end, we\nanalyze a database documenting every transaction for 1000 US stocks over the\ntwo-year period 1994-1995. We find that price movements are equivalent to a\ncomplex variant of diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient fluctuates\ndrastically in time. We relate the analog of the diffusion coefficient to two\nmicroscopic quantities: (i) the number of transactions $N_{\\Delta t}$ in\n$\\Delta t$, which is the analog of the number of collisions and (ii) the local\nvariance $w^2_{\\Delta t}$ of the price changes for all transactions in $\\Delta\nt$, which is the analog of the local mean square displacement between\ncollisions.

Demands to replace our monumental tax code\nwith a simple, graceful one that does not distort economic incentives heat up\nperiodically in political debate, but such dreams never materialize. A\nFUNDAMENTAL obstacle, not yet well understood in the economic literature, is\nthe impossibility of objectively evaluating the tax base -- assets, income,\netc. One can see this even in toy examples, say, trying to assess the value of\na position in chess: great masters' assessments will all differ. Here computer\ntheory can add an insight not provided by classical economics tools.\n  A way around is to avoid evaluations by expressing the tax in natural units,\nnot in cash. For publicly traded corporations, these could be corporate shares.\nI discuss a simple (postcard-sized in ALL details) corporate tax system that\navoids ANY distortion of incentives. (Tax tools MEANT to influence corporate\npolicies should be set as explicit separate taxes or credits, open to public\nscrutiny, not hidden between lines of an incomprehensible tax code.) Roughly,\nthe~system is to periodically take a t*i fraction of shares to auction, where t\nis the tax rate, i is the interest rate. It replaces all income taxes on\npublicly traded corporations, their subsidiaries, and shareholders.\n  The interest rate is defined via specially designed bonds, so that the whole\nsystem can be shown PRECISELY equivalent to a flat tax on INVESTMENT RETURN.\nNote that taxing the return DIRECTLY is impossible: it would invite\nmanipulation of stock market~prices. The main feature is that nothing\ncorporations and investors do can change their tax (t*i fraction of shares), so\nthey would do business exactly the SAME WAY they would WITHOUT TAXES.\n"

Our framework takes as inputs the prior\ndistributions of the parameters of the stochastic process followed by the\nunderlying, as well as the likelihood function implied by the observed price\nhistory for the underlying. Our work extends that of Karolyi (1993) and\nDarsinos and Satchell (2001), but with the crucial difference that the\nlikelihood function we use for inference is that which is directly implied by\nthe underlying, rather than imposed in an ad hoc manner via the introduction of\na function representing \"measurement error.\" As such, an important problem\nstill relevant for our method is that of model risk, and we address this issue\nby describing how to perform a Bayesian averaging of parameter inferences based\non the different models considered using our framework.\n"

The structure of this exchange is motivated by the limit order book\nmechanism used in stock markets. Both buyers and sellers are elastic in the\nprice-quantity space; however, only the sellers are assumed to be patient, i.e.\nonly the sellers have a price - time elasticity, whereas the buyers are assumed\nto be impatient. Sellers select their selling price as a best response to all\nthe other sellers' strategies. We define and establish the existence of the\nequilibrium in this model and show how to numerically compute this equilibrium.\nWe also show how to compute other relevant quantities such as the equilibrium\nexpected time to sale and equilibrium expected order density, as well as the\nexpected order density conditioned on current selling price. We derive a closed\nform for the equilibrium distribution when the demand is price independent. At\nthis equilibrium the selling (limit order) price distribution is power tailed\nas is empirically observed in order driven financial markets.\n"

This models are known to be substantially\nmore flexible than Gaussian based models. One current problem of this approach\nis the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based\nstochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.\n  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and\nShephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is\nlikelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose\nmean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common\nunobserved Poisson random measure. The analysis of these models is facilitated\nby applying the methods in James (2005, 2002), in particular an Esscher type\ntransform of Poisson random measures; in conjunction with a special case of the\nWeber-Sonine formula. It is shown that the marginal likelihood may be expressed\nin terms of a multidimensional Fourier-cosine transform. This yields tractable\nforms of the likelihood and also allows a full Bayesian posterior analysis of\nthe integrated volatility process. A general formula for the posterior density\nof the log price given the observed data is derived, which could potentially\nhave applications to option pricing. We extend the models to include leverage\neffects in section 5. It is shown that inference does not necessarily require\nsimulation of random measures.

However, the ``classical'' super\nreplication price is a sensible indicator of the (maximum selling) value of the\nclaim. When f satisfies certain pointwise conditions (e.g., f is bounded from\nbelow), the super replication price is equal to sup_QE_Q[f], where Q varies on\nthe whole set of pricing measures. Unfortunately, this price is often too high:\na typical situation is here discussed in the examples.

In this article we first prove results on absolute continuity\nfor laws of projected jump-diffusion processes in finite and infinite\ndimensions, and a general result on the existence of Malliavin weights in\nfinite dimension.

To this end\none needs so-called Malliavin weights and we give explicit formulae valid in\npresence of jumps: (a) In a non-degenerate situation, the extended BEL formula\nrepresents possible Malliavin weights as Ito integrals with explicit\nintegrands; (b) in a hypoelliptic setting we review work of Arnaudon and\nThalmaier [1] and also find explicit weights, now involving the Malliavin\ncovariance matrix, but still straight-forward to implement.

We give some financial\nexamples covered by (b) but note that most practical cases of poor Monte Carlo\nperformance, Digital Cliquet contracts for instance, can be dealt with by the\nextended BEL formula and hence without any reliance on Malliavin calculus at\nall. We then discuss some of the approximations, often ignored in the\nliterature, needed to justify the use of the Malliavin weights in the context\nof standard jump diffusion models.

Asymmetric transactions\nare typical for chain-trading groups who arrange their business such that\ncommodities move from senior to junior partners and money moves in the opposite\ndirection. The price-invariance of transactions means that the probability of a\npairwise interaction is a function of the ratio of incomes, which is\nindependent of the price scale or absolute income level. These two features\ncharacterize the hierarchical model. The income distribution in this class of\nmodels is a well-defined double-Pareto function, which possesses Pareto tails\nfor the upper and lower incomes. For gross and net upper incomes, the model\npredicts definite values of the Pareto exponents, $a_{\\rm gross}$ and $a_{\\rm\nnet}$, which are stable with respect to quantitative variation of the\npair-interaction. The Pareto exponents are also stable with respect to the\nchoice of a demand function within two classes of status-dependent behavior of\nagents: linear demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=1$, $a_{\\rm net}=2$) and unlimited slowly\nvarying demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1$). For the sigmoidal demand that\ndescribes limited returns, $a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1+\\alpha$, with some\n$\\alpha>0$ satisfying a transcendental equation. The low-income distribution\nmay be singular or vanishing in the neighborhood of the minimal income; in any\ncase, it is $L_1$-integrable and its Pareto exponent is given explicitly.\n  The theory used in the present study is based on a simple balance equation\nand new results from multiplicative Markov chains and exponential moments of\nrandom geometric progressions.\n"

This has important applications to multiple assets price modeling for\nforecasting, option pricing, risk and credit risk management. An approach\ncommonly used to estimate IC is to take the sum of the cross products of the\ntwo processes increments; however this estimator can be highly biased in the\npresence of jumps, since it approaches the quadratic ovariation, which contains\nalso the co-jumps. Our estimator of IC is based on a threshold (or truncation)\ntechnique. We prove that the estimator is consistent in both cases as the\nnumber of observations increases to infinity. Further, in presence of only\nfinite activity jumps 1) \\hat{IC} is also asymptotically Gaussian; 2) a joint\nCLT for \\hat{IC} and threshold estimators of the integrated variances of the\nsingle processes allows to reach consistent and asymptotically Gaussian\nestimators even of the $\\beta$s and of the correlation coefficient among the\ndiffusion parts of the two processes, allowing a better measurement of their\ndependence; 3) thresholding gives an estimate of IC which is robust to the\nasynchronicity of the observations. We conduct a simulation study to check that\nthe application of our technique is in fact informative for values of the step\nbetween the observations large enough to avoid the typical problems arising in\npresence of microstructure noises in the data, and to asses the choice of the\nthreshold parameters.\n"

However, very little\nattention has been paid to the statistical properties of the estimation of the\nratio. Lo (2002) derived the $\\sqrt{n}$-normality of the ratio's estimation\nerrors for returns which are iid or stationary with serial correlations, and\npointed out that to make inference on the accuracy of the estimation, the\nserial correlation among the returns needs to be taken into account. In the\npresent paper a class of time series models for returns is introduced to\ndemonstrate that there exists a factor other than the serial correlation of the\nreturns that dominates the asymptotic behavior of the Sharpe ratio statistics.\nThe model under consideration is a linear process whose innovation sequence has\nsummable coefficients and contains a latent volatility component which is\nlong-memory. It is proved that the estimation errors of the ratio are\nasymptotically normal with a convergence rate slower than $\\sqrt{n}$ and that\nthe estimation deviation of the expected return makes no contribution to the\nlimiting distribution.\n"

Finally we show\nthat time consistent dynamic pricing allows both to extend the dynamics of some\nreference assets and to be consistent with any observed bid ask spreads that\none wants to take into account.

It is in the insurance company's\ninterest to detect the change time as soon as possible in order to re-evaluate\na new fair value for premiums to keep its profit level the same. This is\nequivalent to a problem in which the intensity and the jump size change at the\nsame time but the intensity changes to a random variable with a know\ndistribution. This problem becomes an optimal stopping problem for a Markovian\nsufficient statistic. Here, a special case of this problem is solved, in which\nthe rate of the arrivals moves up to one of two possible values, and the\nMarkovian sufficient statistic is two-dimensional.\n"

There are two scaling regimes with a crossover time around $t_c\n=40$ min. We consider the original data sets and the modified data sets\nobtained by removing the daily jumps, which occur due to the difference between\nthe closing index and the opening index. To clarify the origin of the\nmultifractality, we also smooth the data through convolution with a Gaussian\nfunction. After convolution we observe that the multifractality disappears in\nthe short-time scaling regime $t<t_c$, but remains in the long-time scaling\nregime $t>t_c$, regardless of whether or not the daily jumps are removed. We\nsuggest that multifractality in the short-time scaling regime is caused by the\nlocal fluctuations of the stock index. But the multifractality in the long-time\nscaling regime appears to be due to the intrinsic trading properties, such as\nherding behavior, information outside the market, the long memory of the\nvolatility, and the nonlinear dynamics of the stock market.\n"

We consider a discrete\nMarkov chain model. This model in some aspects is similar to well-known Ising\nmodel describing ferromagnetics. Namely we consider a set of N investors, each\nof whom has either bullish or bearish opinion, denoted by plus or minus\nrespectively. At every time step each of N investors can change his/her sign.\nThe probability of a plus becoming a minus and the probability of a minus\nbecoming a plus depends only on the bullish sentiment described as the number\nof bullish investors among the total of N investors. The number of bullish\ninvestors then forms a Markov chain whose transition matrix is calculated\nexplicitly. The transition matrix of that chain is ergodic and any initial\ndistribution of bullish investors converges to stationary. Stationary\ndistributions of bullish investors in this Markov chain model are similar to\ncontinuous distributions of the \"theory of social imitation\" of Callen and\nShapero. Distributions obtained this way can represent 3 types of market\nbehavior: one-peaked distribution that is close to Gaussian, transition market\n(flattening of the top), and two-peaked distribution.\n"

This consensus\nhas been built upon a dynamic general equilibrium model of optimal monetary\npolicy as developed by, e.g., Goodfriend and King (1997), Clarida et al.\n(1999), Svensson (1999) and Woodford (2003). In this paper we extend the\nstandard optimal monetary policy model by introducing nonlinearity into the\nPhillips curve. Under the specific form of nonlinearity proposed in our paper\n(which allows for convexity and concavity and secures closed form solutions),\nwe show that the introduction of a nonlinear Phillips curve into the structure\nof the standard model in a discrete time and deterministic framework produces\nradical changes to the major conclusions regarding stability and the efficiency\nof monetary policy. We emphasize the following main results: (i) instead of a\nunique fixed point we end up with multiple equilibria; (ii) instead of\nsaddle--path stability, for different sets of parameter values we may have\nsaddle stability, totally unstable equilibria and chaotic attractors; (iii) for\ncertain degrees of convexity and/or concavity of the Phillips curve, where\nendogenous fluctuations arise, one is able to encounter various results that\nseem intuitively correct. Firstly, when the Central Bank pays attention\nessentially to inflation targeting, the inflation rate has a lower mean and is\nless volatile; secondly, when the degree of price stickiness is high, the\ninflation rate displays a larger mean and higher volatility (but this is\nsensitive to the values given to the parameters of the model); and thirdly, the\nhigher the target value of the output gap chosen by the Central Bank, the\nhigher is the inflation rate and its volatility.\n"

The parameters characterizing the stochastic\ndynamics are determined empirically from the historical quotes for the daily,\nweekly, and monthly series. The results show existence of statistically\nsignificant correlations between the subsequent market moves. The weekly and\nmonthly parameters are calculated in terms of the daily parameters, assuming\nthat the Markov chains with two-step correlations give a complete description\nof the market stochastic dynamics. We show that the macro- and micro-parameters\nobey the renorm group equation. The comparison of the parameters determined\nfrom the renorm group equation with the historical values shows that the Markov\nchains approach gives reasonable predictions for the weekly quotes and\nunderestimates the probability for continuation of the down trend in the\nmonthly quotes. The return and its dispersion for the \"buy-and-hold\" and\n\"follow-trend\" strategies are calculated. The problem of how to combine these\ntwo strategies to reduce the dispersion is discussed and its analytical\nsolution is proposed. The results of the constructing a \"computer-based\"\nstrategy which combines the series analysis with the candlesticks charting\ntechniques are reported.\n"

        "abstract": "  Quantum theory is used to model secondary financial markets. Contrary to\nstochastic descriptions, the formalism emphasizes the importance of trading in\ndetermining the value of a security. All possible realizations of investors\nholding securities and cash is taken as the basis of the Hilbert space of\nmarket states. The temporal evolution of an isolated market is unitary in this\nspace. Linear operators representing basic financial transactions such as cash\ntransfer and the buying or selling of securities are constructed and simple\nmodel Hamiltonians that generate the temporal evolution due to cash flows and\nthe trading of securities are proposed. The Hamiltonian describing financial\ntransactions becomes local when the profit/loss from trading is small compared\nto the turnover. This approximation may describe a highly liquid and efficient\nstock market. The lognormal probability distribution for the price of a stock\nwith a variance that is proportional to the elapsed time is reproduced for an\nequilibrium market. The asymptotic volatility of a stock in this case is\nrelated to the long-term probability that it is traded.\n"

The probability density function\nof the returns is written as the squared modulus of an amplitude. For short\ntime intervals this amplitude is proportional to a Cauchy-distribution and\nsatisfies the Schroedinger equation with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. The\nobserved power law tails of the return fluctuations imply that the \"decay\nrate\", $\\gamma(q)$ asymptotically is proportional to $|q|$, for large $|q|$.\nThe wave number, the Fourier-conjugate variable to the return, is interpreted\nas a quantitative measure of \"market sentiment\". On a time scale of less than a\nfew weeks, the distribution of returns in this quantum model is shape stable\nand scales. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed cumulative\ndistribution for the short-term normalized returns over 7 orders of magnitude\nwithout adjustable parameters. The return fluctuations over large time periods\nultimately become Gaussian if $\\gamma(q\\sim 0)\\propto q^2$.

We compute the risk-neutral probability\ndensity conditional on the total variance of the asset's returns when the\noption expires. If the asset's future price has finite expectation, the\noption's fair value satisfies a parabolic partial differential equation of the\nBlack-Scholes type in which the variance of the asset's returns rather than a\ntrading time is the evolution parameter. By immunizing the portfolio against\nlarge-scale price fluctuations of the asset, the valuation of options is\nextended to the realistic case\\cite{St99} of assets whose short-term returns\nhave finite variance but very large, or even infinite, higher moments. A\ndynamic Delta-hedged portfolio that is statically insured against exceptionally\nlarge fluctuations includes at least two different options on the asset. The\nfair value of an option in this case is determined by a universal drift\nfunction that is common to all options on the asset. This drift is interpreted\nas the premium for an investment exposed to risk due to exceptionally large\nvariations of the asset's price. It affects the option valuation like an\neffective cost-of-carry for the underlying in the Black-Scholes world would.\nThe derived pricing formula for options in realistic markets is arbitrage free\nby construction.

The paper presents evidence\nwhich shows that reactions to major shocks are often dominated by a small\nnumber of institutional players. Most often the market gets a wrong perception\nand inadequate understanding of such events because the relevant information\n(e.g. the fact that one mutual fund has sold several million shares) only\nbecomes available weeks or months after the event, through reports to the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our observations suggest that there\nis a radical difference between small ($ < 0.5% $) day-to-day price variations\nwhich may be due to the interplay of many agents and large ($ >5% $) price\nchanges which, on the contrary, may be caused by massive sales (or purchases)\nby a few players.

There\nare, however, anomalous natural and artificial systems that violate the basic\nrequirements for its applicability. Different physical entropies, other than\nthe standard one, appear to be necessary in order to satisfactorily deal with\nsuch anomalies. One of such entropies is $S_q \\equiv k (1-\\int dx\n[f(x)]^q)/(1-q)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$), where the entropic index $q$ is a real\nparameter. It has been proposed as the basis for a generalization, referred to\nas {\\it nonextensive statistical mechanics}, of the $BG$ theory. $S_q$ shares\nwith $S_{BG}$ four remarkable properties, namely {\\it concavity} ($\\forall\nq>0$), {\\it Lesche-stability} ($\\forall q>0$), {\\it finiteness of the entropy\nproduction per unit time} ($q \\in \\Re$), and {\\it additivity} (for at least a\ncompact support of $q$ including $q=1$). The simultaneous validity of these\nproperties suggests that $S_q$ is appropriate for bridging, at a macroscopic\nlevel, with classical thermodynamics itself. In the same natural way that\nexponential probability functions arise in the standard context,power-law\ntailed distributions, even with exponents {\\it out} of the L\\'evy range, arise\nin the nonextensive framework. In this review, we intend to show that many\nprocesses of interest in economy, for which fat-tailed probability functions\nare empirically observed, can be described in terms of the statistical\nmechanisms that underly the nonextensive theory.\n"

To elaborate how the martingale for the Libor\nbelongs to the general class of numeraire for the forward interest rates, two\nother numeraire's are considered, namely the money market measure that makes\nthe evolution of the zero coupon bonds a martingale, and the forward measure\nfor which the forward bond price is a martingale. The price of an interest rate\ncap is computed for all three numeraires, and is shown to be numeraire\ninvariant.

In these cases -- in order to uncover\ntheir key features -- we have to turn to empirical methods, one of which was\nrecently introduced by Menezes and Barabasi. It is based on the observation\nthat for the activity f_i(t) of the constituents there is a power law\nrelationship between the standard deviation and the mean value: sigma_i ~\n<f_i>^alpha. For stock market trading activity (traded value), good scaling\nover 5 orders of magnitude with the exponent alpha = 0.72 was observed. The\norigin of this non-trivial scaling can be traced back to a proportionality\nbetween the rate of trades <N> and their mean sizes <V>. One finds <V> ~\n<N>^0.69 for the ~1000 largest companies of New York Stock Exchange. Model\nindependent calculations show that these two types of scaling can be mapped\nonto each other, with an agreement between the error bars.

In its mean-field incarnation, our model exhibits a two-time-scale\nglassy dynamics, as well as an astonishing universality.When preference is\ngiven to local interactions in finite neighbourhoods,a novel feature emerges:\ninstead of at most one overall winner in the system,finite numbers of winners\nemerge, each one the overlord of a particular region.The patterns formed by\nsuch winners (metastable states) are very much a consequence of initial\nconditions, so that the fate of the marketplace is ruled by its past history;\nhysteresis is thus also manifested.\n"

        "abstract": "  The question of optimal portfolio is addressed. The conventional Markowitz\nportfolio optimisation is discussed and the shortcomings due to non-Gaussian\nsecurity returns are outlined. A method is proposed to minimise the likelihood\nof extreme non-Gaussian drawdowns of the portfolio value. The theory is called\nLeptokurtic, because it minimises the effects from \"fat tails\" of returns. The\nleptokurtic portfolio theory provides an optimal portfolio for investors, who\ndefine their risk-aversion as unwillingness to experience sharp drawdowns in\nasset prices. Two types of risks in asset returns are defined: a fluctuation\nrisk, that has Gaussian distribution, and a drawdown risk, that deals with\ndistribution tails. These risks are quantitatively measured by defining the\n\"noise kernel\" -- an ellipsoidal cloud of points in the space of asset returns.\nThe size of the ellipse is controlled with the threshold parameter: the larger\nthe threshold parameter, the larger return are accepted for investors as normal\nfluctuations. The return vectors falling into the kernel are used for\ncalculation of fluctuation risk. Analogously, the data points falling outside\nthe kernel are used for the calculation of drawdown risks. As a result the\nportfolio optimisation problem becomes three-dimensional: in addition to the\nreturn, there are two types of risks involved. Optimal portfolio for\ndrawdown-averse investors is the portfolio minimising variance outside the\nnoise kernel. The theory has been tested with MSCI North America, Europe and\nPacific total return stock indices.\n"

These factors include interest\nrate, interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility and exchange\nrates. Standard statistical AIC and Wilks tests allow us to compare the\nexplanatory power of the different proposed factor models. We find that the\nhistorical volatility played the key role before August of 2002. Around October\n2002, the interest rate dominated. In the first six months of 2003, the foreign\nexchange rate became the key factor. Since the end of 2003, all factors have\nplayed an increasingly large role. However, the most surprising result is that\nthe best model is the second-order LPPL without any factor. We thus present a\nscenario for the future evolution of the US stock market based on the\nextrapolation of the fit of the second-order LPPL formula, which suggests that\nherding is still the dominating force and that the unraveling of the US stock\nmarket antibubble since 2000 is still qualitatively similar to (but\nquantitatively different from) the Japanese Nikkei case after 1990.\n"

In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; group1 plays\nthe majority game, but the group2 plays the minority game. The results show\nthat the correlations between the average winnings of agents and the mean of\nlocal volatilities are different with different combinations of agents' memory\nlengths when the proportion of agents in group1 increases.

For\nmesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the\nprobability) follows an exponential law. At longer times, the exponential law\ncontinuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.\n  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the\nsubordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the\nnumber of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.\nThis subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns\nfor time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day. Finally, we\nshow that the CIR process describes well enough the empirical V_t process, such\nthat the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns x_t\nprocess, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows.\n  Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution. We\nfind that the personal income distribution in the USA has a well-defined\ntwo-income-class structure. The majority of population (97-99%) belongs to the\nlower income class characterized by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibb(``thermal'')\ndistribution, whereas the higher income class (1-3% of population) has a Pareto\npower-law (``superthermal'') distribution.

The\nmain contribution is associated with the autocorrelation property of stock\nreturns. We introduce and solve analytically both a two-state and a three-state\nMarkov chain models.

With a power-law distribution of\ntime horizons, we obtain a model that captures most stylized facts of financial\ntime series: Student-like distribution of returns with a power-law tail,\nlong-memory of the volatility, slow convergence of the distribution of returns\ntowards the Gaussian distribution, multifractality and anomalous volatility\nrelaxation after shocks. At variance with recent multifractal models that are\nstrictly time reversal invariant, the model also reproduces the time assymmetry\nof financial time series: past large scale volatility influence future small\nscale volatility. In order to quantitatively reproduce all empirical\nobservations, the parameters must be chosen such that our model is close to an\ninstability, meaning that (a) the feedback effect is important and\nsubstantially increases the volatility, and (b) that the model is intrinsically\ndifficult to calibrate because of the very long range nature of the\ncorrelations. By imposing the consistency of the model predictions with a large\nset of different empirical observations, a reasonable range of the parameters\nvalue can be determined. The model can easily be generalized to account for\njumps, skewness and multiasset correlations.\n"

        "abstract": "  Recently, in order to explore the mechanism behind wealth or income\ndistribution, several models have been proposed by applying principles of\nstatistical mechanics. These models share some characteristics, such as\nconsisting of a group of individual agents, a pile of money and a specific\ntrading rule. Whatever the trading rule is, the most noteworthy fact is that\nmoney is always transferred from one agent to another in the transferring\nprocess. So we call them money transfer models. Besides explaining income and\nwealth distributions, money transfer models can also be applied to other\ndisciplines. In this paper we summarize these areas as statistical\ndistribution, economic mobility, transfer rate and money creation. First, money\ndistribution (or income distribution) can be exhibited by recording the money\nstock (flow). Second, the economic mobility can be shown by tracing the change\nin wealth or income over time for each agent. Third, the transfer rate of money\nand its determinants can be analyzed by tracing the transferring process of\neach one unit of money. Finally, money creation process can also be\ninvestigated by permitting agents go into debts. Some future extensions to\nthese models are anticipated to be structural improvement and generalized\nmathematical analysis.\n"

The models on which our investigations were performed are the basic\nmodel proposed by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko [1], the model with uniform\nsaving rate developed by A. Chakraborti and B.K. Chakrabarti [2], and its\nextended model with diverse saving rate [3]. The velocity of circulation is\nfound to be inversely related with the average holding time of money. In order\nto check the nature of money transferring process in these models, we\ndemonstrated the probability distributions of holding time. In the model with\nuniform saving rate, the distribution obeys exponential law, which indicates\nmoney transfer here is a kind of Poisson process. But when the saving rate is\nset diversely, the holding time distribution follows a power law. The velocity\ncan also be deduced from a typical individual's optimal choice. In this way, an\napproach for building the micro-foundation of velocity is provided. In order to\nexpose the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution in microscope, we examined\nthe mobility by collecting the time series of agents' rank and measured it by\nemploying an index raised by economists. In the model with uniform saving rate,\nthe higher saving rate, the slower agents moves in the economy. Meanwhile, all\nof the agents have the same chance to be the rich. However, it is not the case\nin the model with diverse saving rate, where the assumed economy falls into\nstratification.

Groot, Physica A 353 (2005) 501]. To\ninvestigate the cause of this, the influence of social interactions and\nadvertisements are studied in an agent-based model of consumers in a social\nnetwork. The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world\nnetwork, a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network. The degree to which\nconsumers value the opinion of their peers was also varied. On a small-world\nand random network we find a phase-transition between an open market and a\nlocked-in market that is similar to condensation in liquids. At the critical\npoint, fluctuations become large and buying behaviour is strongly correlated.\nHowever, on the small world network the noise distribution at the critical\npoint is Gaussian, and critical slowing down occurs which is not observed in\nsupermarket sales. On a scale-free network, the model shows a transition\nbetween a gas-like phase and a glassy state, but at the transition point the\nnoise amplitude is much larger than what is seen in supermarket sales. To\nexplore the role of advertisements, a model is studied where imprints are\nplaced on the minds of consumers that ripen when a decision for a product is\nmade. The correct distribution of weekly sales returns follows naturally from\nthis model, as well as the noise amplitude, the correlation time and\ncross-correlation of sales fluctuations. For particular parameter values,\nsimulated sales correlation shows power law decay in time. The model predicts\nthat social interaction helps to prevent aversion, and that products are viewed\nmore positively when their consumption rate is higher.\n"

        "abstract": "  We show that financial correlations exhibit a non-trivial dynamic behavior.\nWe introduce a simple phenomenological model of a multi-asset financial market,\nwhich takes into account the impact of portfolio investment on price dynamics.\nThis captures the fact that correlations determine the optimal portfolio but\nare affected by investment based on it. We show that such a feedback on\ncorrelations gives rise to an instability when the volume of investment exceeds\na critical value. Close to the critical point the model exhibits dynamical\ncorrelations very similar to those observed in real markets. Maximum likelihood\nestimates of the model's parameter for empirical data indeed confirm this\nconclusion, thus suggesting that real markets operate close to a dynamically\nunstable point.\n"

        "abstract": "  The NYSE and NASDAQ stock markets have very different structures and there is\ncontinuing controversy over whether differences in stock price behaviour are\ndue to market structure or company characteristics. As the influence of market\nstructure on stock prices may be obscured by exogenous factors such as demand\nand supply, we hypothesize that modulation of the flow of transactions due to\nmarket operations may carry a stronger imprint of the internal market\nmechanism. We analyse times between consecutive transactions (ITT) for NYSE and\nNASDAQ stocks, and we relate the dynamical properties of the ITT with those of\nthe corresponding price fluctuations. We find a robust scale-invariant temporal\norganisation in the ITT of stocks which is independent of individual company\ncharacteristics and industry sector, but which depends on market structure. We\nfind that stocks registered on the NASDAQ exhibit stronger correlations in\ntheir transaction timing within a trading day, compared with NYSE stocks.\nFurther, we find that companies that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show\na reduction in the correlation strength of transaction timing within a trading\nday, after the move, suggesting influences of market structure. Surprisingly,\nwe also observe that stronger power-law correlations in the ITT are coupled\nwith stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher price\nvolatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of ITT\nand the corresponding price fluctuations over a broad range of time scales.\nComparing the NYSE and NASDAQ, we demonstrate that the higher correlations we\nfind in ITT for NASDAQ stocks are matched by higher correlations in absolute\nprice returns and by higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may\naffect price behaviour through information contained in transaction timing.\n"

In this work we study\nthe network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we\ncompute the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on\nownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward\ninvestment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the\nownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the\nintuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development,\nto our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet. In this\npaper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling laws of activity,\ninvestment stock and connectivity degree both at the level of firms and at the\nlevel of regions. In particular we find that investment stock of firms is power\nlaw distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for firm activity.\nOn the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn out to be\nlog-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment\nto activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock\nscales with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for\nstock market data, calling for further investigations on a possible general\nscaling law holding true in economical networks.\n"

We\nmake a step in this direction by developing empirical models that capture\nbehavioral regularities in trading order placement and cancellation using data\nfrom the London Stock Exchange. For order placement we show that the\nprobability of placing an order at a given price is well approximated by a\nStudent distribution with less than two degrees of freedom, centered on the\nbest quoted price. This result is surprising because it implies that trading\norder placement is symmetric, independent of the bid-ask spread, and the same\nfor buying and selling. We also develop a crude but simple cancellation model\nthat depends on the position of an order relative to the best price and the\nimbalance between buying and selling orders in the limit order book. These\nresults are combined to construct a stochastic representative agent model, in\nwhich the orders and cancellations are described in terms of conditional\nprobability distributions. This model is used to simulate price formation and\nthe results are compared to real data from the London Stock Exchange. Without\nadjusting any parameters based on price data, the model produces good\npredictions for the magnitude and functional form of the distribution of\nreturns and the bid-ask spread.\n"

We investigate this\nhypothesis using tick by tick data from the New York and London Stock Exchanges\nand show that only a small fraction of volatility fluctuations are explained in\nthis manner. Clustered volatility is still very strong even if price changes\nare recorded on intervals in which the total transaction volume or number of\ntransactions is held constant. In addition the distribution of price returns\nconditioned on volume or transaction frequency being held constant is similar\nto that in real time, making it clear that neither of these are the principal\ncause of heavy tails in price returns. We analyze recent results of Ane and\nGeman (2000) and Gabaix et al. (2003), and discuss the reasons why their\nconclusions differ from ours. Based on a cross-sectional analysis we show that\nthe long-memory of volatility is dominated by factors other than transaction\nfrequency or total trading volume.\n"

In a nutshell, according to this view, being competitively\nselfish adds value for all. But to what degree can doing good add competitive\nvalue to products and services?

Such a distribution\ntypically goes through a maximum at a time coined the {\\em optimal investment\nhorizon}, $\\tau^*_\\rho$, which defines the most likely waiting time for\nobtaining a given return $\\rho$. By considering equal positive and negative\nlevels of return, we reported in [2,3] on a quantitative gain/loss asymmetry\nmost pronounced for short horizons.

The most\nreasonable explanation for this fact is that the gain/loss asymmetry observed\nin the DJIA as well as in the SP500 and Nasdaq are due to movements in the\nmarket as a whole, {\\it i.e.}, cooperative cascade processes (or\n``synchronization'') which disappear in the inverse statistics of the\nindividual stocks.\n"

The basic idea which stays behind\nthis choice is that, in competitive markets, a greater quantity of the good is\nexchanged at a lower and a lower price, leading to higher market efficiency.\nElectricity markets are pretty different from other commodities mainly due to\nthe physical constraints related to the network structure that may impact the\nmarket performance. The network structure of the system on which the economic\ntransactions need to be undertaken poses strict physical and operational\nconstraints. Strategic interactions among producers that game the market with\nthe objective of maximizing their producer surplus must be taken into account\nwhen modeling competitive electricity markets. The physical constraints,\nspecific of the electricity markets, provide additional opportunity of gaming\nto the market players. Game theory provides a tool to model such a context.\nThis paper discussed the application of game theory to physical constrained\nelectricity markets with the goal of providing tools for assessing the market\nperformance and pinpointing the critical network constraints that may impact\nthe market efficiency. The basic models of game theory specifically designed to\nrepresent the electricity markets will be presented.

For\nexample, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated\ntransactions, there is also more liquidity for buy orders than sell orders, so\nthat buy orders generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell\norders. At the moment a buy order is placed the transaction sign imbalance\ntends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance\nrapidly increases with time, so that after a small number of time steps it\ncancels all the inefficiency caused by the transaction sign imbalance, bounding\nthe price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and\ntemporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue\nthat viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a\nsimpler and more natural view. This is in the spirit of the original conjecture\nof Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build\nup of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction. We discuss the possible\nstrategic motivations that give rise to the liquidity imbalance and offer an\nalternative hypothesis. We also present some results that call into question\nthe statistical significance of large swings in expected price impact at long\ntimes.\n"

The statistical properties of the data are relatively\nhomogeneous within the same day but the large jumps between different days\nprevent the extension of the analysis to large times. This leads to intrinsic\nfinite size effects which alter the apparent Hurst (H) exponent. We show, by\nanalytical methods, that finite size effects always lead to an enhancement of\nH. We then consider the effect of fat tails on the analysis of the roughness\nand show that the finite size effects are strongly enhanced by the fat tails.\nThe non stationarity of the stock price dynamics also enhances the finite size\neffects which, in principle, can become important even in the asymptotic\nregime. We then compute the Hurst exponent for a set of stocks of the NYSE and\nargue that the interpretation of the value of H is highly ambiguous in view of\nthe above results. Finally we propose an alternative determination of the\nroughness in terms of the fluctuations from moving averages with variable\ncharacteristic times. This permits to eliminate most of the previous problems\nand to characterize the roughness in useful way. In particular this approach\ncorresponds to the automatic elimination of trends at any scale.\n"

In these class\nof models the key ingredient necessary for having a self-organized scale-free\nsteady-state distribution is the trading or collision rule where agents or\nparticles save a definite fraction of their wealth or energy and invests the\nrest for trading. Using a Gibbs ensemble approach we could obtain the exact\ndistribution of wealth in this model. Moreover we show that in this model (a)\ngood savers are always rich and (b) every agent poor or rich invests the same\namount for trading.

Standard analyzing techniques include correlation coefficients for\npairs of signals and correlation matrices for rich multivariate data. In the\nlatter case one constructs a real symmetric matrix with real non-negative\neigenvalues describing the correlation structure of the data. However, if one\nperforms a correlation-function-like analysis of multivariate data, when a\nstress is put on investigation of delayed dependencies among different types of\nsignals, one can calculate an asymmetric correlation matrix with complex\neigenspectrum. From the Random Matrix Theory point of view this kind of\nmatrices is closely related to Ginibre Orthogonal Ensemble (GinOE). We present\nan example of practical application of such matrices in correlation analyses of\nempirical data. By introducing the time lag, we are able to identify temporal\nstructure of the inter-market correlations. Our results show that the American\nand German stock markets evolve almost simultaneously without a significant\ntime lag so that it is hard to find imprints of information transfer between\nthese markets. There is only an extremely subtle indication that the German\nmarket advances the American one by a few seconds.\n"

For the first passage\nprocesses of the Sony Bank US dollar/Japanese yen (USD/JPY) exchange rate, we\nevaluate the average waiting time which is defined as the average time that\ncustomers have to wait between any instant when they want to observe the rate\n(e.g. when they log in to their computer systems) and the next rate change. We\nfind that the assumption of exponential distribution for the first-passage\nprocess should be rejected and that a Weibull distribution seems more suitable\nfor explaining the stochastic process of the Sony Bank rate. Our approach also\nenables us to evaluate the expected reward for customers, i.e. one can predict\nhow long customers must wait and how much reward they will obtain by the next\nprice change after they log in to their computer systems. We check the validity\nof our prediction by comparing it with empirical data analysis.\n"

We start in Section 2 with some introductory remarks on\nthe topics and approaches that will be discussed later on. Then we have a view\non the developments in banking regulation that have enforced the interest of\nthe public in validation techniques. When doing so, we put the main emphasis on\nthe issues with quantitative validation. The techniques discussed here could be\nused in order to meet the quantitative regulatory requirements. However, their\nappropriateness will depend on the specific conditions under which they are\napplied. In order to have a common ground for the description of the different\ntechniques, we introduce in Section 3 a theoretical framework that will be the\nbasis for the further considerations. Intuitively, a good rating system should\nshow higher probabilities of default for the less creditworthy rating grades.\nTherefore, in Section 4, we discuss how this monotonicity property is reflected\nin the theoretical framework from Section 3. In Section 5, we study the meaning\nof discriminatory power and some tools for measuring it in some detail. We will\nsee that there are tools that might be more appropriate than others for the\npurpose of regulatory validation of discriminatory power. The topic in Section\n6 is calibration of rating systems. We introduce some of the tests that can be\nused for checking correct calibration and discuss the properties of the\ndifferent tests. We then conclude in Section 7 with some comments on the\nquestion which tools might be most appropriate for quantitative validation of\nrating systems and probabilities of default.\n"

Moreover, the discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT) provides additional insight on the series breakdown. In\nparticular, in comparison to other methods, the benefit of the wavelet\ntransform is that it provides a way to study the sensitivity of the series to\nincreases in amplitude of fluctuations as well as changes in frequency.\nFinally, based on results for these methods, in particular, those for DWT of\nraw (or original), squared and absolute returns, it can be concluded that there\nis strong indication for persistence in the volatilities of the emerging stock\nmarket returns for the Irish data.\n"

This generalization to track possible changes of\ncorrelation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention\n(or consensus) to another. Numerical simulations on synthetic time series\nverify that the new TOP method performs as expected even in the presence of\nsubstantial noise.

We\ncompare the results for the Portuguese Stock Market Index PSI 20 with six other\nStock Market Indices, namely the S&P 500, FTSE100, DAX 30, CAC 40, ASE 20, and\nIBEX 35.

We\nalso test for asymmetry after controlling for the effect of macroeconomic\nfactors on stock market returns using TAR and M-TAR specifications within a VAR\nframework. Our results show that the conditional variance is an asymmetric\nfunction of past innovations raising proportionately more during market\ndeclines, a phenomenon known as the leverage effect. However, when we control\nfor the effect of changes in macroeconomic variables, we find no significant\nevidence of asymmetric behaviour of the stock market returns. There are some\nsigns that the Portuguese Stock Market tends to show somewhat less market\nefficiency than other markets since the effect of the shocks appear to take a\nlonger time to dissipate.\n"

We suppose that the object of\ninterest of agents, called here baskets, form a vector space over the reals. A\nportfolio is defined as an equivalence class of baskets containing assets in\nthe same proportions. Therefore portfolios form a projective space. Cross\nratios, being invariants of projective maps, form key structures in the\nproposed model. Quotation with respect to an asset X (i.e. in units of X) are\ngiven by linear maps. Among various types of metrics that have financial\ninterpretation, the min-max metrics on the space of quotations can be\nintroduced. This metrics has an interesting interpretation in terms of rates of\nreturn. It can be generalized so that to incorporate a new numerical parameter\n(called temperature) that describes agent's lack of knowledge about the state\nof the market. In a dual way, a metrics on the space of market quotation is\ndefined. In addition, one can define an interesting metric structure on the\nspace of portfolios/quotation that is invariant with respect to hyperbolic\n(Lorentz) symmetries of the space of portfolios.

For risk\nmanagement, knowledge of the entire RND provides more information for\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) calculations than implied volatility alone [1]. Typically,\nRNDs are deduced from option prices by making a distributional assumption, or\nrelying on implied volatility [2]. We present a fully non-parametric method for\nextracting RNDs from observed option prices. The aim is to obtain a continuous,\nsmooth, monotonic, and convex pricing function that is twice differentiable.\nThus, irregularities such as negative probabilities that afflict many existing\nRND estimation techniques are reduced. Our method employs neural networks to\nobtain a smoothed pricing function, and a central finite difference\napproximation to the second derivative to extract the required gradients.\n  This novel technique was successfully applied to a large set of FTSE 100\ndaily European exercise (ESX) put options data and as an Ansatz to the\ncorresponding set of American exercise (SEI) put options. The results of paired\nt-tests showed significant differences between RNDs extracted from ESX and SEI\noption data, reflecting the distorting impact of early exercise possibility for\nthe latter. In particular, the results for skewness and kurtosis suggested\ndifferent shapes for the RNDs implied by the two types of put options. However,\nboth ESX and SEI data gave an unbiased estimate of the realised FTSE 100\nclosing prices on the options' expiration date. We confirmed that estimates of\nvolatility from the RNDs of both types of option were biased estimates of the\nrealised volatility at expiration, but less so than the LIFFE tabulated\nat-the-money implied volatility.\n"

Continuous time random walks (CTRWs) are general models capable to\ncapture the small-scale properties that high frequency data series show. The\nuse of CTRW models in the analysis of financial problems is quite recent and\ntheir potentials have not been fully developed. Here we present two (closely\nrelated) applications of great interest in risk control. In the first place, we\nwill review the problem of modelling the behaviour of the mean exit time (MET)\nof a process out of a given region of fixed size. The surveyed stochastic\nprocesses are the cumulative returns of asset prices. The link between the\nvalue of the MET and the timescale of the market fluctuations of a certain\ndegree is crystal clear. In this sense, MET value may help, for instance, in\ndeciding the optimal time horizon for the investment. The MET is, however, one\namong the statistics of a distribution of bigger interest: the survival\nprobability (SP), the likelihood that after some lapse of time a process\nremains inside the given region without having crossed its boundaries. The\nfinal part of the article is devoted to the study of this quantity. Note that\nthe use of SPs may outperform the standard \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) method for two\nreasons: we can consider other market dynamics than the limited Wiener process\nand, even in this case, a risk level derived from the SP will ensure (within\nthe desired quintile) that the quoted value of the portfolio will not leave the\nsafety zone.

In\nfinance, the particle jumps are log-returns and the waiting times measure delay\nbetween transactions. These two random variables (log-return and waiting time)\nare typically not independent. For these coupled CTRW models, we can now\ncompute the limiting stochastic process (just like Brownian motion is the limit\nof a simple random walk), even in the case of heavy tailed (power-law) price\njumps and/or waiting times. The probability density functions for this limit\nprocess solve fractional partial differential equations.

As already reported in several articles, self-consistency\nimplies correlations between the return disturbances. As a consequence, the\nalpha's and beta's of the factor model are unobservable. Self-consistency leads\nto renormalized beta's with zero effective alpha's, which are observable with\nstandard OLS regressions. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations show\nthat, for arbitrary choices of the proxy which are different from the true\nmarket portfolio, a modified linear regression holds with a non-zero value\n$\\alpha_i$ at the origin between an asset $i$'s return and the proxy's return.\nSelf-consistency also introduces ``orthogonality'' and ``normality'' conditions\nlinking the beta's, alpha's (as well as the residuals) and the weights of the\nproxy portfolio. Two diagnostics based on these orthogonality and normality\nconditions are implemented on a basket of 323 assets which have been components\nof the S&P500 in the period from Jan. 1990 to Feb. 2005. These two diagnostics\nshow interesting departures from dynamical self-consistency starting about 2\nyears before the end of the Internet bubble.

It\nis helpful in estimating risk of an investor's portfolio, which arises from our\nlack of information, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of reality, which\nforbids a perfect prediction of future price changes. Despite of many\nadvantages this tool is not known and is not widely used among investors on\nWarsaw Stock Exchange. The main reason for abandoning this method is a high\nlevel of complexity and immense calculations. The aim of this paper is to\nintroduce an automatic decision - making system, which allows a single investor\nto use such complex methods of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The key tool in\nMPT is an analysis of an empirical covariance matrix. This matrix, obtained\nfrom historical data is biased by such a high amount of statistical\nuncertainty, that it can be seen as random. By bringing into practice the ideas\nof Random Matrix Theory (RMT), the noise is removed or significantly reduced,\nso the future risk and return are better estimated and controlled. This\nconcepts are applied to the Warsaw Stock Exchange Simulator http://gra.onet.pl.\nThe result of the simulation is 18 % level of gains in comparison for\nrespective 10 % loss of the Warsaw Stock Exchange main index WIG.\n"

We study the waiting\ntime statistics between consecutive spot price spikes and find it to show\nanomalous scaling characterized by a decaying power-law. The exponent observed\nin data follows a quite robust relationship with the one implied by the DEA\nanalysis. We also in terms of the DEA revisit topics like clustering,\nmean-reversion and periodicities. We finally propose a GARCH inspired model but\nfor the price itself. Models in the context of stochastic volatility processes\nappear under this scope to have a feasible description.\n"

One aspect of\nthe solution to this problem involves determining characteristics of the\ndistribution of fluctuations in returns. Empirical studies conducted over the\nlast decade have reported that they arenon-Gaussian, scale in time, and have\npower-law(or fat) tails. However, because they use sliding interval methods of\nanalysis, these studies implicitly assume that the underlying process has\nstationary increments. We explicitly show that this assumption is not valid for\nthe Euro-Dollar exchange rate between 1999-2004. In addition, we find that\nfluctuations in returns of the exchange rate are uncorrelated and scale as\npower-laws for certain time intervals during each day. This behavior is\nconsistent with a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient that depends\nboth on the time and the price change. Within scaling regions, we find that\nsliding interval methods can generate fat-tailed distributions as an artifact,\nand that the type of scaling reported in many previous studies does not exist.\n"

        "abstract": "  We study the sensitivity to estimation error of portfolios optimized under\nvarious risk measures, including variance, absolute deviation, expected\nshortfall and maximal loss. We introduce a measure of portfolio sensitivity and\ntest the various risk measures by considering simulated portfolios of varying\nsizes N and for different lengths T of the time series. We find that the effect\nof noise is very strong in all the investigated cases, asymptotically it only\ndepends on the ratio N/T, and diverges at a critical value of N/T, that depends\non the risk measure in question. This divergence is the manifestation of a\nphase transition, analogous to the algorithmic phase transitions recently\ndiscovered in a number of hard computational problems. The transition is\naccompanied by a number of critical phenomena, including the divergent sample\nto sample fluctuations of portfolio weights. While the optimization under\nvariance and mean absolute deviation is always feasible below the critical\nvalue of N/T, expected shortfall and maximal loss display a probabilistic\nfeasibility problem, in that they can become unbounded from below already for\nsmall values of the ratio N/T, and then no solution exists to the optimization\nproblem under these risk measures. Although powerful filtering techniques exist\nfor the mitigation of the above instability in the case of variance, our\nfindings point to the necessity of developing similar filtering procedures\nadapted to the other risk measures where they are much less developed or\nnonexistent. Another important message of this study is that the requirement of\nrobustness (noise-tolerance) should be given special attention when considering\nthe theoretical and practical criteria to be imposed on a risk measure.\n"

A shock followed by such a power law decay in the rate is here called\nOmori process. Studying several aftercrash time series, we show that the Omori\nlaw holds not only after significant market crashes, but also after\n``intermediate shocks''. Moreover, we find self-similar features in the\nvolatility. Specifically, within the aftercrash period there are smaller shocks\nthat themselves constitute Omori processes on smaller scales, similar to the\nOmori process after the large crash. We call these smaller shocks subcrashes,\nwhich are followed by their own aftershocks. We also find similar Omori\nprocesses after intermediate crashes in time regimes without a large market\ncrash. By appropriate detrending we remove the influence of the crashes and\nsubcrashes from the data, and find that this procedure significantly reduces\nthe memory in the records. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that\nthe memory in volatility is related to Omori processes present on different\ntime scales.\n"

Despite the significance of such phenomena, measuring economic\nglobalization still remains an open problem. More quantitative treatments could\nimprove the understanding of globalization at the same time that help a formal\nbasis for comparative economic history. In this letter, we investigate the time\nevolution of the statistical properties of bilateral trade imbalances between\ncountries in the trade system. We measure their cumulative probability\ndistribution at different moments in time to discover a sudden transition circa\n1960 from a regime where the distribution was always represented by a steady\ncharacteristic function to a new state where the distribution dilates as time\ngoes on. This suggests that the rule that was governing the statistical\nbehavior of bilateral trade imbalances until the 60's abruptly changed to a new\nform persistent in the last decades. In the new regime, the figures for the\ndifferent years collapse into a universal master curve when rescaled by the\ncorresponding global gross domestic product value. This coupling points to an\nincreased interdependence of world economies and its onset corresponds in time\nwith the starting of the last globalization wave.\n"

A promising line of research involves the early detection of\nprecursory log-periodic oscillations to help forecast extreme events in\ncollective phenomena where discrete scale invariance plays an important role.\nHere I investigate two distinct approaches towards the general problem of how\nto detect log-periodic oscillations in arbitrary time series without prior\nknowledge of the location of the moveable singularity. I first show that the\nproblem has a definite solution in Fourier space, however the technique\ninvolved requires an unrealistically large signal to noise ratio. I then show\nthat the quadrature signal obtained via analytic continuation onto the\nimaginary axis, using the Hilbert transform, necessarily retains the\nlog-periodicities found in the original signal. This finding allows the\ndevelopment of a new method of detecting log-periodic oscillations that relies\non calculation of the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal. I illustrate\nthe method by applying it to the well documented stock market crash of 1987.\nFinally, I discuss the relevance of these findings for parametric rather than\nnonparametric estimation of critical times.\n"

We\nalso shows that the degree distribution of the MSTs for both stock markets\nfollows a power-law distribution with the exponent $\\zeta \\sim$ 2.1, while the\ndegree distribution of the time series eliminated a nonlinearity follows an\nexponential distribution with the exponent, $\\delta \\sim 0.77$.

Diffusion theory has many common\npoints with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that\nvolatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for\nthe price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from\nprice data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which\ntogether with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a\nmaximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion\nprocesses. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic\nvolatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of\nvolatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results\nare: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is\nconsistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to\ntrading volume by a power law of the form $\\sigma \\propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)\nfuture returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some\ndegree of predictability for the size of future returns.\n"

        "abstract": "  The statistical properties of the bid-ask spread of a frequently traded\nChinese stock listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange are investigated using the\nlimit-order book data. Three different definitions of spread are considered\nbased on the time right before transactions, the time whenever the highest\nbuying price or the lowest selling price changes, and a fixed time interval.\nThe results are qualitatively similar no matter linear prices or logarithmic\nprices are used. The average spread exhibits evident intraday patterns\nconsisting of a big L-shape in morning transactions and a small L-shape in the\nafternoon. The distributions of the spread with different definitions decay as\npower laws. The tail exponents of spreads at transaction level are well within\nthe interval $(2,3)$ and that of average spreads are well in line with the\ninverse cubic law for different time intervals. Based on the detrended\nfluctuation analysis, we found the evidence of long memory in the bid-ask\nspread time series for all three definitions, even after the removal of the\nintraday pattern. Using the classical box-counting approach for multifractal\nanalysis, we show that the time series of bid-ask spread does not possess\nmultifractal nature.\n"

A bubble is defined by a faster-than-exponential acceleration with\nsignificant log-periodic oscillations. The faster-than-exponential acceleration\ncharacteristics are tested with several different metrics, including\nnonlinearity on the logarithm of the price and power law fits. The log-periodic\nproperties are investigated in detail using the first-order log-periodic\npower-law (LPPL) formula, the parametric detrending method, the\n$(H,q)$-analysis, and the second-order Weierstrass-type model, resulting in a\nconsistent and robust estimation of the fundamental angular log-frequency\n$\\omega_1 =7\\pm 2$, in reasonable agreement with previous estimations on many\nother bubbles in developed and developing markets. Sensitivity tests of the\nestimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency are performed by\nvarying the first date and the last date of the stock price time series. These\ntests show that the estimated parameters are robust. With the insight of 6\nadditional month of data since the analysis was performed, we observe that many\nof the stocks on the South Africa market experienced an abrupt drop mid-June\n2006, which is compatible with the predicted $t_c$ for several of the stocks,\nbut not all. This suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-June of\n2006 was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubbly\nacceleration bound to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on the\nS&P500 US market from Oct. 1997 to Aug. 1998.\n"

In the conventional derivation of the theorem, it\nis apparently hard to evaluate the higher order moments of the waiting time. To\novercome this type of difficulties, we attempt to derive the waiting time\ndistribution Omega(s) directly for arbitrary time interval distribution (first\npassage time distribution) of the stochastic process P_{W}(tau) and observation\ntime distribution P_{O}(t) of customers. Our analysis enables us to evaluate\nnot only the first moment (the average waiting time) but also any order of the\nhigher moments of the waiting time. Moreover, in our formalism, it is possible\nto model the observation of the price on the internet by the customers in terms\nof the observation time distribution P_{O}(t).

Here, we show that, even for arbitrary\nlarge economies when the distribution of the capitalization of firms is\nsufficiently heavy-tailed as is the case of real economies, there may exist a\nnew source of significant systematic risk, which has been totally neglected up\nto now but must be priced by the market. This new source of risk can readily\nexplain several asset pricing anomalies on the sole basis of the\ninternal-consistency of the market model. For this, we derive a theoretical\ntwo-factor model for asset pricing which has empirically a similar explanatory\npower as the Fama-French three-factor model. In addition to the usual market\nrisk, our model accounts for a diversification risk, proxied by the\nequally-weighted portfolio, and which results from an ``internal consistency\nfactor'' appearing for arbitrary large economies, as a consequence of the\nconcentration of the market portfolio when the distribution of the\ncapitalization of firms is sufficiently heavy-tailed as in real economies. Our\nmodel rationalizes the superior performance of the Fama and French three-factor\nmodel in explaining the cross section of stock returns: the size factor\nconstitutes an alternative proxy of the diversification factor while the\nbook-to-market effect is related to the increasing sensitivity of value stocks\nto this factor.\n"

Specifically, we have raised $v$ to some real value\n$\\alpha $ or $\\beta $, which introduces a bias for small ($ \\alpha, \\beta <0$)\nor large ($\\alpha, \\beta >1$) values. Our results show that small values of $v$\nare regularly \\emph{anti-correlated} with values at other scales of traded\nvolume. This is consistent with the high liquidity of the 30 equities analysed\nand the asymmetric form of the multi-fractal spectrum for traded volume which\nhas supported the dynamical scenario presented by us.\n"

We argue that chain arbitrage exploitation should not exist,\nwhich provides an a contrario consistency criterion. Remarkably, all the stocks\ninvestigated in Paris Stock Exchange have dynamically consistent price impact\nfunctions. Both the bid-ask spread and the feedback of sequential same-side\nmarket orders onto both sides of the order book are essential to ensure\nconsistency at the smallest time scale.\n"

        "abstract": "  Detailed empirical studies of publicly traded business firms have established\nthat the standard deviation of annual sales growth rates decreases with\nincreasing firm sales as a power law, and that the sales growth distribution is\nnon-Gaussian with slowly decaying tails. To explain these empirical facts, a\ntheory is developed that incorporates both the fluctuations of a single firm's\nsales and the statistical differences among many firms. The theory reproduces\nboth the scaling in the standard deviation and the non-Gaussian distribution of\ngrowth rates. Earlier models reproduce the same empirical features by splitting\nfirms into somewhat ambiguous subunits; by decomposing total sales into\nindividual transactions, this ambiguity is removed. The theory yields\nverifiable predictions and accommodates any form of business organization\nwithin a firm. Furthermore, because transactions are fundamental to economic\nactivity at all scales, the theory can be extended to all levels of the\neconomy, from individual products to multinational corporations.\n"

It means that the variance and the mean of a specific\nquantity are related as $\\ev{\\sigma^2|n}\\propto \\ev{n|A}^{2\\alpha}$ with\n$1/2\\geq \\alpha \\geq 1$ when a parameter $A$ (usually the system size) is\nvaried. $A$ can be the strength of the node, the capitalization of the firm or\nthe area of the habitat. On the other hand, quantities often obey gap scaling\nmeaning that their density function depends on, say, the system size $A$ as\n$P(n|A) = n^{-1}F(n/A^{\\Phi})$. This note describes that these two notions\ncannot coexist except when $\\alpha = 1$.

        "abstract": "  In this paper we discuss a closed-form approximation of the likelihood\nfunctions of an arbitrary diffusion process. The approximation is based on an\nexponential ansatz of the transition probability for a finite time step $\\Delta\nt$, and a series expansion of the deviation of its logarithm from that of a\nGaussian distribution. Through this procedure, dubbed {\\em exponent expansion},\nthe transition probability is obtained as a power series in $\\Delta t$. This\nbecomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included, and\nprovides remarkably accurate results even when truncated to the first few (say\n3) terms. The coefficients of such expansion can be determined\nstraightforwardly through a recursion, and involve simple one-dimensional\nintegrals.\n  We present several examples of financial interest, and we compare our results\nwith the state-of-the-art approximation of discretely sampled diffusions\n[A\\\"it-Sahalia, {\\it Journal of Finance} {\\bf 54}, 1361 (1999)]. We find that\nthe exponent expansion provides a similar accuracy in most of the cases, but a\nbetter behavior in the low-volatility regime. Furthermore the implementation of\nthe present approach turns out to be simpler.\n  Within the functional integration framework the exponent expansion allows one\nto obtain remarkably good approximations of the pricing kernels of financial\nderivatives. This is illustrated with the application to simple path-dependent\ninterest rate derivatives. Finally we discuss how these results can also be\nused to increase the efficiency of numerical (both deterministic and\nstochastic) approaches to derivative pricing.\n"

By\nconstruction, it has no linear predictability (zero two-point correlation) but\na certain nonlinear predictability (non-zero three-point correlation). It can\nthus be considered as a paradigm for testing the existence of a possible\nnonlinear predictbility in a given time series. We present a rather exhaustive\nstudy of the process, including its ability to produce fat-tailed distribution\nfrom Gaussian innovations, the unstable characteristics of the inversion of the\nkey nonlinear parameters and of the two initial conditions necessary for the\nimplementation of a prediction scheme and an analysis of the associated\nsuper-exponential sensitivity of the inversion of the innovations in the\npresence of a large impluse. Our study emphasizes the conditions under which a\ndegree of predictability can be achieved and describes a number of different\nattempts, which overall illuminates the properties of the process. In\nconclusion, notwithstanding its remarkable simplicity, the bilinear stochastic\nprocess exhibits remarkably rich and complex behavior, which makes it a serious\ncandidate for the modeling of financial times series and of other complex\nsystems.\n"
